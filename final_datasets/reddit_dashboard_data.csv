1mdf3yk,PSA(?) GRO possibly hacked?,"I apologize as this post is not directly related to UK Visa, but I did want to put a warning out there.

Folks here have been very helpful, and I'm unsure if any of those here actually also work or have connections with the GRO.  Many of us applying may request documents from the GRO, so I thought this was germane to the sub.  If not, I would appreciate somewhere else I might contact as I doubt just emailing the GRO at their main number will do anything.

I requested some documents from the GRO in March.  I used a credit card (I'm US based with a US credit card) which I almost never use.  In fact it hadn't been used all year (including up until now) with the exception of this one transaction.  The reason I used it is it because it has 0% foreign transaction fee.

Well, I just got a fraud alert from my bank for a $29 transaction for EPA DU MUSEE DU LOVRE.

This sounds like it is for the Louvre Museum in Paris.

I just found it incredibly coincidental that a card that was used only once all year in the UK happens to have a fradulent charge just next door.  I have had fraudulent charges before on various cards over the past 10 years, but all have been US based.

Maybe it's nothing but coincidence.  Maybe the GRO has been hacked.  Maybe it is one lone employee taking numbers out of the system?  Maybe it's nothing, but I just wanted to put it out there.

1mdb3kj,Advice needed - Fiancé visa to Spouse visa or marriage abroad,"I'd really appreciate some advice on my current situation.

I, (27F), am a British Citizen living in the UK as a doctor and plan on getting married to my Fiancé, (28M), who is currently living and working in Ireland. He is a foreign national. Our wedding reception is abroad in December 2025. We are unsure of the best course of action to take regarding the visa situation. We currently have the following 2 options for the spouse visa:

1 - Do our religious marriage + wedding ceremony abroad together in December, and obtain the relevant documents to verify this is a genuine, registered marriage from the UAE. (Not quite sure how to do this at the moment)

2- Apply for a fiancé visa and do the civil and religious marriage in the UK within the months before December. This will then be used for the spouse visa application. 

I have concerns about option 1; can this certificate that I obtain from the UAE be used as a valid marriage certificate for the spouse visa? Does anyone know what steps are required to verify/validate this, if any? 

If we apply for the fiancé visa, can my fiancé enter the UK on his standard visitor's visa in the meantime? 

If then switching the fiancé visa to a spousal visa, how long does the process take for approval?

1md9757,"Partner refused renewal, looking for help before contacting a lawyer","Hi all, 

I've been combing through this thread looking for immigration attorneys and seen many people say to ask this group before contacting one, so here goes. I'm going to give as much info as possible, while staying vague for privacy. 

I've been in the UK since 2016, and am looking at 10 years via long residency next autumn. I've been on a tier 4, tier 2, tier 4 again, graduate, and finally unmarried partner visa. It's been a journey. I thought that I was finally in the home stretch, but things have gone massively downhill with my partner and they have made it clear they are not interested in renewing the visa (leaving me with a 6 month gap before ILR) and they want out. This has been heartbreaking and terrifying with the new changes to the rules. I work as a freelancer in an artistic field, and had thought if it came to this I would take a break from my freelance work to go and try to get a similarly skilled Tier 2 job like I held in the past (covid happened). The recent changes mean all the jobs i am qualified for have been removed from the list, apart from one on the temporary shortage list but it is a huge long shot as it again is a role that is predominantly freelance. 

As far as I am aware, and through much research,  my understanding is that my industry (at my level) is not eligible for global talent. As I am on a partner visa pursuing another relationship would be unrealistic. My understanding is that self sponsorship through setting up a limited company would also be challenging as you need another person within said company to oversee the visa, on top of proof of funds. I am considering applying for further education as the absolute last resort due to the huge expense (and hoping that I can easily apply for ILR at the end of it without having to repeat this stress in a year, as student visa to ILR is a bit unclear in my reading). All of this said, I am so close to the end of this road I don't want to lose everything now. I feel like I've considered every possible avenue, and am hoping someone will think of something I haven't. 

Otherwise, if anyone can recommend a solicitor who will do consultations (rather than the whole deal upfront) just so I can drill into this with specific questions and make sure I really have exhausted the list I would hugely appreciate it. Hugs and thanks to anyone reading, I know we're all having a really tough month.

1md6l9f,English Language Proof for FLRM/ILR,"Hi all, hoping this is a quick one to answer. 

My partner is on a spouse visa and we've booked a GESE Grade 5 B1 Selt for UKVI english test with Trinity College London.

According to the gov website she can use it for ILR as well provided she stays on this route.

Can someone just sanity check that this is correct and that the GESE Grade 5 B1 UKVI Selt with Trinity college is the correct test for her?

* **Sponsor:**
   * Are all of the maintenance funds required in a bank account with your name on it? → **No**

* Statements from a personal bank or building society account
* Building society passbook
* Letter from a bank, building society or other recognised financial institution

1mcrhcg,ILR Eligibility for Dependent Spouse (Student + Skilled Worker + Planned Global Talent) and IHS Refund – British Academy Endorsement,"Hi all,

I’d really appreciate advice on a complex ILR scenario for my family, as I prepare to switch from a **Skilled Worker visa** to the **Global Talent visa** (Exceptional Promise via **peer review from the British Academy**). Here's our full timeline and the questions I’m trying to clarify.

# 🧾 My Visa History:

* **Student visa**: **12 November 2020 – 7 August 2024**
* **Skilled Worker visa**: **7 August 2024 – August 2025**
* **Planning to apply for Global Talent visa**: **10 August 2025**, for **2 years**
* I expect to apply for **ILR in August 2027**, based on **1 year Skilled Worker + 2 years Global Talent**

# 🧾 My Wife’s Timeline:

* **Student Dependent visa** (linked to my student visa): **15 February 2021 – 22 January 2025**
* **Skilled Worker Dependent visa**: **23 January 2025 – Present**, **valid until 15 September 2028**
* If she switches to **GTV Dependent** in **August 2025**, she will have:
   * 3 years as Student Dependent
   * \~7 months as Skilled Worker Dependent
   * 2 years as Global Talent Dependent (projected)

# 🧾 My Children:

* Same dependent history as my wife (3 years Student Dependent + Skilled Worker Dependent since Jan 2025)

# ❓ My Questions:

1. **ILR Eligibility for My Wife and Children**
   * If my wife switches to GTV Dependent in August 2025, can she include her **3 years as Student Dependent** toward the **5-year ILR requirement**?
   * Would she be eligible for **ILR around August/September 2026** (after 5 years as my dependent)?
   * Can **our children** apply for ILR at the same time?
2. **Timing vs. My ILR**
   * I will be eligible for ILR in **August 2027**.
   * Can my wife apply for ILR **before me**, or does she need to apply **with or after me**?
3. **Switching to GTV Dependent**
   * Is it **necessary or advisable** to switch my wife and children to **GTV Dependent** now?

I’d really appreciate advice on a complex ILR scenario for my family, as I prepare to switch from a **Skilled Worker visa** to the **Global Talent visa** (Exceptional Promise via **peer review from the British Academy**). Here's our full timeline and the questions I’m trying to clarify.

# 🧾 My Visa History:

* **Student visa**: **12 November 2020 – 7 August 2024**
* **Skilled Worker visa**: **7 August 2024 – August 2025**
* **Planning to apply for Global Talent visa**: **10 August 2025**, for **2 years**
* I expect to apply for **ILR in August 2027**, based on **1 year Skilled Worker + 2 years Global Talent**

# 🧾 My Wife’s Timeline:

* **Student Dependent visa** (linked to my student visa): **15 February 2021 – 22 January 2025**
* **Skilled Worker Dependent visa**: **23 January 2025 – Present**, **valid until 15 September 2028**
* If she switches to **GTV Dependent** in **August 2025**, she will have:
   * 3 years as Student Dependent
   * \~7 months as Skilled Worker Dependent
   * 2 years as Global Talent Dependent (projected)

# 🧾 My Children:

* Same dependent history as my wife (3 years Student Dependent + Skilled Worker Dependent since Jan 2025)

# ❓ My Questions:

1. **ILR Eligibility for My Wife and Children**
   * If my wife switches to GTV Dependent in August 2025, can she include her **3 years as Student Dependent** toward the **5-year ILR requirement**?
   * Would she be eligible for **ILR around August/September 2026** (after 5 years as my dependent)?
   * Can **our children** apply for ILR at the same time?
2. **Timing vs. My ILR**
   * I will be eligible for ILR in **August 2027**.
   * Can my wife apply for ILR **before me**, or does she need to apply **with or after me**?
3. **Switching to GTV Dependent**
   * Is it **necessary or advisable** to switch my wife and children to **GTV Dependent** now?
   * If they remain on their current **Skilled Worker Dependent visas (valid until 15 September 2028)**, will that **delay or affect their ILR eligibility**?
4. **IHS Refund**
   * Since their current visas run to **Sept 2028**, but we may switch them to GTV Dependent in **August 2025**, will we be eligible for an **IHS refund**?
      * Will the refund be **automatic**?
      * How many **6-month blocks** could we expect to be refunded?
5. **Any Other Considerations**

1mcjxah,UK Student Visa: Can I deposit or withdraw money during the 28-day bank statement period,"Hi everyone,

I’m a pakistani and i am applying for a UK Student Visa and I’m a bit confused about the 28-day bank statement rule.

I know I need to show that I’ve held the required funds (tuition + living expenses) in my account for at least 28 consecutive days before applying. But I have two specific questions:

1. Can I withdraw money during those 28 days, given as long as the balance never drops below the required amount which was tuition+ living expenses?


2. Can I make a deposit during that period? For example, if I already have the required amount but deposit a few more in the account on Day 5, does the 28-day clock reset and start from that day?

1mcibog,Evidence relating to partner and our address for ILR (10-year route),"Hi everyone, I am due to submit my ILR application in 2 weeks under the 'Long Residence'/10-year route. I am applying on the basis of:

\- undertaking my PhD from Sep 2015 onwards under the Tier-4 student visa until Jan 2020  
\- Doctoral Extension Visa from Jan 2020-Feb 2021  
\- Skilled Worker from Feb 2021 to July 2022  
\- Skilled Worker extension from July 2022 - July 2027

I work at the same institution where I undertook my PhD, haven't switched employers, no gaps in the above history and absences well below the requirements. Hopefully this is a straightforward application!

I started filling out the form today to get a jump on it and it asks you for your relationship status. I am in a live-in relationship with a British citizen and we hope to formalise this soon, but not in the immediate future. Hence, I put down my status as 'Unmarried Partner'.

""Evidence you have to prove the relationship with 'Partner Name' (for example marriage certificates), and correspondence addressed either to you jointly, or in both of your names, or addressed individually to you at the same address, to cover the last two years""

I'm a bit stumped as my immigration status has never depended on my partner and I was not anticipating having to provide this. I have only 2 pieces of joint correspondence addressed to both of us (one from from 2022 and 2024), tenancy agreement with my name (and his name as the approved occupier) and a few pieces addressed to us individually showing the same address. I'm not sure how to prove my relationship status unless I supply texts, photos etc but I'm not sure if this is relevant as I'm not applying on the basis of this relationship.

1mci6yh,Unmarried partner visa eligibility advice,"Hello! I’m applying for an unmarried partner visa and I’m a bit nervous about the outcome, so i was hoping to get some perspective from others on if i have reason to be!

background: i am a US citizen, and i have lived in the UK for the last three years while attending university (which i have just completed). My partner, who is a British citizen, and I met and started dating almost 3 years ago, a few weeks after starting university. We’ve been in a committed relationship ever since, and have been to visit each other’s families for extended periods (up to a month) during university vacations, as well as taking holidays together. Because we lived in student housing, we did not technically live together until last year, when we shared a flat with friends, but we have shared a room (essentially living together) for 2 1/2 years now (i even have an email from the domestic manager complaining about him living in my room lol). We cook all meals together and share food shopping expenses, but do not have other shared bills. We plan to move to Scotland in September for his graduate studies and my work, and we have signed a lease on a house together that starts September 1. ). We do not have any bills which are addressed to both of us, as the student housing requirements meant they had to be individual, though I’m sure we could get a letter from our housing manager verifying we lived in the same flat for the last year. And both our names are on the lease of our house for next year. We meet the financial requirements through savings, and we have ample pictures, texts, plane tickets, statements from our flatmates, friends and family etc that show we have been in a committed, serious relationship for the last nearly 3 years. We even have the email records from last December of inquiring about a marriage license before deciding that marriage was not something we wanted to do right now financially/for family reasons.

All to say, i believe we meet all the requirements with the exception of 2 years cohabitation (we technically only have 1, though we lived in the same building prior and stayed with each other every night), and since we lived in student housing, which was the reason we didn’t live together (we weren’t given a choice by the uni), I believe that shouldn’t be a problem.

however, I still feel quite nervous that we’ll be rejected for some reason. my student visa runs out in October 30, and financially I can’t afford to apply for the unmarried partner visa until early October. I know I’m allowed to remain in the UK while awaiting a decision even if my other visa runs out (I believe the law is called Section 3C), but if we‘re denied for any reason I know appeals take months or longer, and returning to the US would be incredibly costly and difficult (not to mention cost of reapplying if needed), especially as I have signed a lease in the UK and will have accepted a job offer here by then as well.

if anyone who has been through the unmarried partner visa process (successful or denied), or knows a lot about it, has any thoughts or insights to share on if we’d likely be approved, or just advice, that would be greatly appreciated!

I’m now closing in on my Family Visa expiration date in just under 3 weeks so I’ve been familiarising myself with the checklist and requirements for gathering documents. I have just hit my 30 months since arriving in the UK. 

The application is 33 months but because of covid and the Ukraine war beginning leading to many to flee to the UK, it led to a large backup in applications. So I couldn’t properly book a flight not knowing if my approval would take 6 weeks or 6 months. On top of that, my carrier lost my package and I got my passport and documents back over a month later. Eventually leading to arriving in the UK 75 days after the start of my visa approval. So I didn’t have a planned date. 

With that being said I have some important questions regarding renewing for FLR:

1. If I apply about 10 days from my visa expiration date, it will add +30 months to my ~30 months ~7 days. So my next application can be Indefinite Leave to Remain? 

2. If the answer is yes, would that mean I have to be quite tight in my timing and have to apply within around 2 weeks from my FLR expiration? 

3. I read in here that I’m legally in the UK even after visa expiration as long as I applied before the expiration on grounds of section 3c. And that all the time spent in the UK after expiration also count towards the 60 months in the UK. Is this correct? If so this seems like a longer approval from Immigration could be beneficial in giving me more time towards ILR so I can apply earlier if I’m not mistaken.

I’m sorry for such a lengthy post that definitely has rambling and I appreciate those that took the time to even glance at this. I’ve looked for this information because I really want to make sure to avoid having to apply and pay for another FLR when I don’t need to.

1mcexck,Family partner visa while claiming pip/ adequate  maintenance,"I'm currently trying to bring my wife over from Canada to live with me in the UK, and I’m really struggling to find clear information on what I need to show financially. I have settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, and our child is already here and settled too.

I don’t meet the £29,000 income requirement, but I do receive PIP (Standard living rate) since 2023, so I think I’m exempt from the minimum income threshold and instead need to meet the adequate maintenance requirement. i think this means I have to show that I have enough income or support to cover living costs for myself, my partner and our kid

The part I’m stuck on is working out what the actual weekly amount is that I need to show, and whether the benefits I receive are enough. currently what i receive:

I receive PIP at £295.60 per month

I claim Universal Credit, with my child included on the claim, my full entitlement is £609.79/month (before deductions), but this depends if I’ve had income that month (i leave jobs regularly depending on health)

I also get Child Benefit at £26.06 per week

I don’t pay rent – I’m living with my mum and stepdad, rent-free

I recently left my job, and I’m waiting on my final payslip (which will show about £1,300 in earnings). My most recent Universal Credit payment dropped to £263 because of that income

I’m also unsure how to present this properly on the application like

Should I say I’m still employed since my final payslip hasn’t arrived yet, or just be upfront that I’ve now left the job?

When it asks for my Universal Credit amount, do I put the full amount I’m entitled to, or the lower amount I actually received after deductions?

1mcejrs,Long-term Standard Visitor Visa with sponsor's SKW expiring,"Hi r/ukvisa

I'm living in the UK on the Skilled Worker Visa and hoping to file for ILR in the first half of 2026. My parents and in-laws previously had 6 months and 2 year Standard Visitor visas with my sponsorship and visited us multiple times.

We want them to visit again, but I'm wondering if they'll get approved for 2/5/10 year visas since my own SKW is about to expire? Or should we wait until the ILR situation clears?

1mcbuav,Confused about my status and future travels to England.,"Hi lovely people! I’d like to ask if you could shed some light into my case. I am a 27 years old Spanish citizen living in Germany.

I previously lived in the UK for about 3 years and a half and I was granted the pre-settled status (I applied for it in January 2020 when I was still living in the UK). However, when I was granted the pre-settled status (march 2020) I was already living in Germany. I lived in Germany for the last 5 and a half years. In late March this year, I got an email from the [UK.gov](http://UK.gov) visa and immigration bureau saying that I got a 5 year extension for my pre-settled status. Could you please tell me if this means that I can move back to the UK whenever I want to? Can I make use of my pre-settled status although I haven’t been living in the UK since 2020? If I move back to the UK in two years, what will happen after this 5 year extension (March 2030)?  



My pre-settled status passport, is an old one and I've traveled back and forth these past 5 years to the UK and back and I never had a problem albeit I used a different (new) passport, and not the one linked to the pre-settled status. 

However, I'm going to England for a graduation (just a short weekend) in September. and I am afraid that if apply for the ETA, my pre-settled might get cancelled at the airport (if stopped by customs) OR if I don't apply for an ETA and link my new passport to the pre-settle status, it will also cancel as it will detect that I haven't lived there for the past years. 

  
What do you recommend me doing? I am asking this because I am tired of living in Germany, and I want to move back to London (as I'm staying a Master's degree there, online) and I'd like to know what my possibilities are. 

Thank you so much for your time and I wish you a great rest of the week.",2025-07-29T13:45:01,awright33333,0,5,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1mcbuav/confused_about_my_status_and_future_travels_to/,['settled status'],"Confused about my status and future travels to England.

1mc82ie,Home Office Administrative Review - conflicting decisions and over a year of delays. What can I do?,"Hi Everyone,

I’m hoping someone can give me some advice because my partner’s immigration case with the Home Office has become a nightmare and we are at odds end of trying to get a resolution.

My partner applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain (Tier 1 Entrepreneur) in April 2024. This was essentially a renewal - we provided the exact same information and evidence that had been approved during his last two extensions. Despite this, the application was refused in July 2024.

The reasons were:

* They claimed one employee couldn’t be counted because he was already “undertaking employment”, even though he was previously just a director/investor and not an employee.
* They questioned the genuineness of another employee despite that same person having been accepted as genuine in the previous application. We also submitted payslips, tax records and correspondence showing his work.
* They questioned the viability of the business, even though that isn’t a requirement for ILR and the company was clearly employing people and operating as normal.

We submitted an Administrative Review a few weeks later.

Almost a year went by with no update (besides an update after 6 month after no update was given and he chased with just a response that 'It's taking longer than usual for Administrative Reviews, up to 12 months or more""). Then in June 2025, out of nowhere, the Home Office said the AR was automatically withdrawn because they believed my partner had left the UK the previous year.

We sent in clear evidence showing this was completely wrong with bank statements, Uber receipts and even an email from the airline saying he was a no‑show on the flight.

Here’s the bit that makes no sense:

* On 10 July the Home Office Complaints Team wrote back upholding our complaint. They admitted their error and said they would reinstate the AR.
* The very next day, a completely different department sent a letter ignoring all of that and saying the AR was still withdrawn.

So now there are two official Home Office positions that directly contradict each other. No one will confirm which one stands, and it’s been over a year since the AR was first submitted. My partner can’t travel, his business has been severely affected, and the stress is awful.

I’ve gone to my MP (my partner’s MP has just been fobbed off with standard “wait and see” replies) but I don’t know what else to do.

Has anyone been through anything like this?

Is there any point escalating to the Independent Examiner of Complaints or Parliamentary Ombudsman?

Would a Judicial Review be the only way to force them to act?

Any advice or similar experiences would be massively appreciated.

1mc61fr,Applying for a Marriage Visitor Visa for the 3rd Time – Need Advice About Bank Accounts and Documents 🙏,"Hi everyone,

I’m a Turkish citizen and I’ve been in a relationship with my British fiancée for around 17 months. I’ve applied for a Marriage Visitor Visa twice before, and unfortunately both were refused. Now, I’m preparing to apply for the third time — mostly because my fiancée really wants us to try once more before giving up.

Here’s my situation:
	•	In my first application, I made a big mistake by not submitting proper bank statements or work-related documents. I was inexperienced and didn’t know better.
	•	In the second application, I included those documents and even added extra evidence — but I still got refused. One of the main reasons was that my documents weren’t translated into English by a certified translator.
	•	I submitted a Pre-Action Protocol (PAP) complaint to challenge the decision, but it was rejected. From that process, I learned that any document not in English or Welsh must be translated by a certified/sworn translator — which I didn’t know before.

Now, I’m rebuilding my application from scratch. I’m getting all my Turkish documents officially translated by a sworn translator, and preparing a complete and transparent file.

⸻

Here’s my big question:

I have two bank accounts:
	1.	Inactive account: I used this in my previous visa applications. I put some money into it specifically for the trip, but I don’t normally use it. The visa officer considered it suspicious and thought I was hiding my real financial situation.
	2.	Active account: This is the one I use daily — for receiving customer payments, shopping, and sending/receiving money to/from my siblings. However, some transactions don’t include clear references or explanations. Over the past 6 months, around £6,000 has gone in and out.

⸻

Which account should I use in my new application?
	•	The active one, which truly shows my financial life but looks messy?
	•	Or the inactive one, which is cleaner but unrealistic?

I want to be fully honest and transparent this time. We just want to get married legally in the UK and spend a short time together. I’m not planning to stay long-term yet — we’ll apply for a spouse visa in the future.

If anyone has gone through something similar, or has experience or advice, I would really appreciate your help. 🙏

Thank you so much!

1mc5zgx,Student visa rejected once due to interview nerves – can I safely apply again in the same September intake?,"Hi everyone, I could really use some advice or reassurance from anyone who's been through something similar.

A few months ago, my UK student visa was rejected. The reason they gave was that they didn’t think I was a genuine student. Honestly, I was just really nervous during the credibility interview and didn’t explain myself properly. I didn’t expect to get so overwhelmed, and I feel like I messed up my answers.

Since then, I’ve spent time getting everything in order. I’ve prepared much better for the interview, my finances are sorted, and I’ve found a different university that I actually really like. I applied through Clearing and they said they’d hold a credibility interview. If I pass that, they’ll issue me a CAS and then I can apply for the visa again for the same September intake.

But this is where I’m stuck. A lot of agencies in Bangladesh keep telling me not to do this. They’re saying that if someone applies twice in the same session, like September to September, the second application gets rejected automatically. I’ve tried looking online but I haven’t found any official UKVI guidance or posts from people confirming whether this is actually true.

So I’m asking here: has anyone ever applied again in the same intake after a visa refusal and actually got accepted? Is it really a rule that they reject you just because it’s the same session? I just want to know if it’s still worth applying or if I’m risking everything by trying again.

I’ve completed all the modules for my degree and am just waiting on the results for my final two. I won’t receive the official degree certificate until December, but I’m planning to apply for ILR in September.

Can I apply without the certificate, and instead submit a letter from my university confirming that I’ve completed my course (taught in English) and am just awaiting the final results? Would this letter be accepted as proof of English language proficiency?

1mc3bbz,My UK student visa experience from a high risk country,"Hey everyone. I wanted to share my experience applying for a UK student visa with a passport from a high risk country. 

Firstly, I applied from Dubai where I have residency, which helped immensely. My university actually told me that I would be treated as someone from Dubai rather than someone from my home country, which was a relief.

Secondly, something that my university did which I don’t think many other universities did (based on what I read on Reddit) is that they themselves approve the documents that I should upload before they issue my CAS. They even did a mock interview with me in case UKVI hit me up for an interview (which they didn’t) but it was appreciated that they wanted to prepare me as much as possible.

Lastly, I did not have any sort of sponsorship. I applied as self funded.

**Timeline:**

July 1st: applied and did my biometrics on the same day.

July 2nd: got the generic email saying that my visa will be delayed beyond the promised timeframe. 

After two weeks, I made a paid inquiry, but they said that it’s still under process.

July 28th: after almost a month, I finally received the email that my application has been successful.

Side note: my university told me that they could also submit an inquiry to UKVI which might help with the application to be processed faster, but that they will only do so if the dates are cutting close for my enrollment. Luckily, we didn’t reach that point as my study starts in September.

Note that I paid for priority service so it should’ve been done within 5 working days, but it stretched to almost one month. They did not ask me for any additional documents or request an interview or any communication. My best guess is that the reason why it was so delayed was because of background/security checks due to my nationality.

**Documents I submitted:**

1- Passport copy

2- Bank statement (28 days)

3- UAE visa residency copy

My university was very strict with me to only upload the documents that the university itself approved in advance, and to not upload any additional documents. I listened to their advice and it worked perfectly.

Some thoughts:

I am happy that I paid for priority as I was about 8 weeks from my planned trip to London. If I wasn’t an applicant from a high risk country, I would’ve stayed with standard since I still had two months. 

Share your documents that you want to upload in advance with the university for them to approve. 

Lastly, don’t stress. Unless there’s something wrong with the documents that you shared, it is highly unlikely for you to be rejected. If I can get it, then anyone can.

I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

1mbzm5j,IELTS Requirements,"Hey guys, I'm just wondering if my college (I'm planning to do an Access to He course) can exercise their discretion to certify my English proficiency even without the IELTS test?

1mbkor6,Spouse visa questions,"Hello there,
So I worked in Holland last year and met a Dutch girl, we've been together since October and I recently popped the question. We're talking about her moving over here as the whole long distance thing is a nightmare.
I've taken this year out and just been living off savings to focus on the relationship as if I stayed with my company I'd have been stationed in Japan.
So my questions are;

1mbjmqz,URGENT: Potential Mistake with Financial Sponsorship Info on Student Visa App,"Hi there, sorry if this post is gonna sound super anxious and dumb, but for context: I applied for a student visa for a masters course, where the course and maintenance fees are being sponsored by my future workplace. They provided a letter of confirmation of sponsorship to my university, but did not provide one to me, so I assumed I didn't need it for my app. Also, I'm from a differential evidence country, so did not provide any financial documents when applying.

I've been spiralling down this subreddit (bad, I know), and realised I may have made a mistake:

For the question of ""If you are being wholly sponsored by an official financial sponsor how will you prove this?”, I answered **“My Student sponsor has confirmed this information on my CAS”**. 

This is because I read this in my CAS: ""***Please note that this is a sponsored student as evident by the letter of confirmation from their official financial sponsor****"",* and interpreted this to mean that information of my sponsorship has been confirmed within the CAS itself. However, from what I’m reading online, this is only if the university is sponsoring me, and I should have instead selected the option of providing a letter of financial sponsorship. 

I know I don't have to supply financial evidence anyways, but just wondering if this clash (i.e. me stating that my student sponsor confirmed it on the CAS vs my CAS stating that it's evident on the letter of confirmation) could be detrimental for my visa outcome? I know I can gather the relevant documents if they request it further down the line, but am really worried this inconsistency could be confusing and lead to an outright refusal. I've sent in an email to my university's international students team for advice, but if anyone here who can provide advice, please please reply to this as I'm quite nervous about the whole visa app!

* My current skilled work visa is **curtailed to 1 Aug 2025**, when I must either apply for a new visa or leave the UK.
* My partner (British citizen) and I are both **unemployed** right now.
* We need to show **£88,500** held in cash savings for a **continuous 6 months** to meet the financial requirement.

**Our savings timeline:**

* I held investments (all my savings) that dipped to the equivalent of **£62,440** in April (due to a market crash), but is now at about **£84k**.
* In early June, a friend gifted us **£14,000**, which pushed our total savings above **£98,000**.
* We’ve now liquidated everything into cash - so on paper we meet the amount - **but** we haven’t held the full £88,500 for 6 continuous months yet. That wouldn’t happen until **December 2025**.

**Why we applied now:**

* If we wait until December, my visa will expire (Aug 1) and we’d lose our rented home, cause huge disruption, and I still can’t work to rebuild savings.
* We felt we had to apply “early” to maintain lawful status, housing, and allow my wife to keep job searching.

**Questions I’m hoping to get advice on:**

1. Has anyone successfully applied before holding the full savings 6 months, using a **Letter of Explanation** or exceptional circumstances?
2. Would a detailed **personal statement** and full disclosure of bank/investment fluctuations help, or just trigger a refusal?
3. Any other advice? 

We intend on applying by August 1 no matter what, because I am not in a position financially or mentally to leave my wife right now. I appreciate any pointers for the application - especially real examples of people who’ve navigated a similar timeline squeeze.

1mbgk1f,Mother's Tourist Visa rejected,"Hi everyone,
I recently applied for a UK visit visa for my mom (family visit) and it was refused under paragraphs V4.2(a) and (c) of Appendix V. The main reasons for the refusal were:

She is currently unemployed and declared no income, but her bank statement showed large unexplained deposits (~37,000 AED / ~7000 Pounds over a month), which raised doubts about her financial credibility - this was from the letter. 

[This is due to the fact that my mom doesn't work, and my father works in real estate so his monthly income fluctuates due to commission but has a salary certificate for 15,000 AED monthly (roughly 3000 or so pounds) and so he usually transfers part of his income for her to use for her purchases]

The caseworker also questioned whether she’d leave the UK at the end of her visit, despite her stating that she would travel with me and return to her spouse who is in our country of residence (UAE).
(I haven't booked my mom's tickets yet as I'm still waiting for my decision on my student visa)

They noted strong family ties to the UK (her brother-in-law and his family) and weren't convinced of her ties to our home country outweighed this.

I want to reapply but I’m unsure how to properly address these concerns, especially around her financial documentation and proving her intention to return. Any advice or experiences with similar situations would be really appreciated.

1mbgivi,HSMP Research,"I decided to dive deeper into the HSMP case, mainly for understanding whether it could serve as a legal precedent to deter the HO / government from applying the lengthened 10-year ILR qualification period to those already on the ""route"" (or avenue / pathway, etc., whatever you like to call it!)

For amateur legal researchers like myself, there's a search engine for UK case laws here: [https://www.bailii.org/form/search\_multidatabase.html](https://www.bailii.org/form/search_multidatabase.html)

If we search for ""HSMP Forum"" there are 26 results (as of today). \[2\] and \[6\] below are the main case laws, and we already know that they contain the “landmark” rulings that were in favour of the migrants. Now we are interested in whether there are **any other cases that were ruled in favour of migrants (against the HO / government), using the two case laws above as precedents?**

See some short comments - in most cases just quoting the key point - on each of the cases below. **Apart from \[13\] and \[17\], where the claimants / appellants were HSMP migrants, all the other cases were ruled in favour of the HO / government. In my words, the HSMP Forum case law does not generalise well**. The key takeaway are the follows:

* There must be a clear, unambiguous, unequivocal “promise” that the terms won’t change in the future, no matter what.
* Even if the individual genuinely holds a legitimate expectation that their leave will ultimately be extended further by the Respondent, they have no absolute right to insist that this will occur, whether or not they meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the date of their application. (“you are likely to be eligible to apply for…"")
* If the group of affected people is large (> few thousands), then unfortunately the macro-economical reasons could prevail and override the “legitimate expectation” (see \[23\] and \[25\] below).

Discussions are welcome, but please discuss professionally in the context of case laws, not “I feel”, “I guess”, etc.

Answer: ""*Not at all.*""

Contrasting such an explicit promise with the case here:

It is clear that the decision in HSMP Forum Limited v SSHD was decided on its own facts and, in particular, on the continuing nature and scope of the commitment entered into by the Secretary of State. **There was a promise that applicants would reap the benefits irrespective of a subsequent change in the Rules.** There is no such material upon which the appellants here can draw.

In the case before me, for the reasons I have already given (see paragraphs 75-85 above), there was no such representation; any such representation would have been contrary to the statute, and consequently could not be relied upon; and, in any event, even had there been such a representation, I have found it would be in the public interest to permit the GMC to change their criteria for acceptable overseas qualifications with immediate effect.

In our judgement all those who have been granted by the Respondent a defined period of leave to enter the UK, or, to remain in the UK (which includes both those with a period of limited leave to remain, and those with a period of discretionary leave to remain), hold during the currency of that leave, an immigration status that is lawful, albeit “precarious”. **Even if the individual genuinely holds a legitimate expectation that their leave will ultimately be extended further by the Respondent, they have no absolute right to insist that this will occur, whether or not they meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the date of their application**; HSMP Forum UK Limited [\[2008\] EWHC 664](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/664.html).

Same reasoning as \[23\]. But also:

The expectation of a continuance of a substantive right is not absolute, even in the strongest cases such as Ex p Coughlan (above), because a sufficient public interest can still override a legitimate expectation to which a representation had given rise. ",2025-07-28T13:42:46,emorgoral,1,7,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1mbgivi/hsmp_research/,['ILR'],"HSMP Research I decided to dive deeper into the HSMP case, mainly for understanding whether it could serve as a legal precedent to deter the HO / government from applying the lengthened 10-year ILR qualification period to those already on the ""route"" (or avenue / pathway, etc., whatever you like to call it!)

For amateur legal researchers like myself, there's a search engine for UK case laws here: [https://www.bailii.org/form/search\_multidatabase.html](https://www.bailii.org/form/search_multidatabase.html)

If we search for ""HSMP Forum"" there are 26 results (as of today). \[2\] and \[6\] below are the main case laws, and we already know that they contain the “landmark” rulings that were in favour of the migrants. Now we are interested in whether there are **any other cases that were ruled in favour of migrants (against the HO / government), using the two case laws above as precedents?**

See some short comments - in most cases just quoting the key point - on each of the cases below. **Apart from \[13\] and \[17\], where the claimants / appellants were HSMP migrants, all the other cases were ruled in favour of the HO / government. In my words, the HSMP Forum case law does not generalise well**. The key takeaway are the follows:

* There must be a clear, unambiguous, unequivocal “promise” that the terms won’t change in the future, no matter what.
* Even if the individual genuinely holds a legitimate expectation that their leave will ultimately be extended further by the Respondent, they have no absolute right to insist that this will occur, whether or not they meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the date of their application. (“you are likely to be eligible to apply for…"")
* If the group of affected people is large (> few thousands), then unfortunately the macro-economical reasons could prevail and override the “legitimate expectation” (see \[23\] and \[25\] below).

1mbbeey,Youth Mobility Scheme - Passport Expiry Concern,"Hi everyone,
I recently got selected for the 2025 Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS). I’m not an Australian citizen, but I currently live in Melbourne and plan to apply for my UK visa from here.

However, I just noticed that my passport will expire in early 2027, which means it won’t cover the full 2-year visa period. From what I’ve read, this might be a problem since ideally your passport should be valid for the entire visa duration.

I’m considering renewing my passport here at the local consulate, but it may take a few weeks. So now I’m unsure whether I should:

1. Go ahead and apply for the UK visa with my current passport, then update the new passport details later?

2. Or wait until I receive my new passport before applying?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I’d really appreciate any advice, especially if you’ve already applied for the YMS and had to deal with passport expiry issues.

1mbaobq,Took Avanse Education Loan (Already Disbursed) — Should I Select “Self-Funding” or “Education Loan” in CAS Shield?,"Hey everyone,

I’m applying for my UK student visa and need some clarity on the CAS Shield funding section.

I’ve taken an education loan from **Avanse**, and the full amount (covering tuition + living) has already been **disbursed into my HSBC account**. The money has been sitting there for over 28 days now.

Since I’m not planning to upload the Avanse sanction letter (they didn’t give me a clean single-page format), I’m instead planning to show:

* My **HSBC 28-day bank statement**
* A **balance certificate** from HSBC as proof of funds.



Now I’m stuck on what to select in the **CAS Shield** form:

* Should I go with **“Education Loan”**, since the source was a loan?
* Or select **“Self-funding”**, since the money is now in my personal account and I’m not using the loan letter?

My agent suggested going with **self-funding** in CAS and visa to avoid conflict or mismatches, since the money is clean and meets the 28-day rule.

Has anyone here dealt with a similar case? Would love some guidance from students who used Avanse or other NBFCs the same way.

1mb8dua,Switching from student visa,"My wife is currently on a Student visa for a 4-year professional doctorate program, which is valid until 2029. I was previously on her dependant visa but have recently switched to a Skilled Worker visa.

She would now like to switch to become my dependant. However, I understand that she may not be able to switch directly while still studying, as she would typically need to complete her course in order to be eligible.

In this case, if she decides to withdraw from her course, and subsequently receives a visa curtailment letter from the Home Office, can she apply to switch to a Skilled Worker dependant visa from within the UK during the curtailment period? Or would she need to return to her home country and apply from there?

Also, would withdrawing from her course and receiving a curtailed visa have any serious implications for future visa applications?

I recently created my UKVI account. But when I try to link it to my eVisa, it asks me to confirm my ID. As you can see from the pic attached.

But the problem is that they're asking me to confirm my ID via UK Immigration: ID Check app. And the app asks for a qr code or a connection code to work. And I'm not sure how any of these methods will work. Like I dont' know where that qr code is located that I need to scan.

1mazudd,EUSS Family Member - Outside Country when CoA issued,"I’m in a tricky situation. My wife qualified for pre-settled status back in 2020 while we were in the UK and I was on a separate visa. We’ve been living in the US temporarily for a couple of years and since then had a child. We are trying to move back to the UK and get all 3 of us on her pre-settled status. Now the trouble is I have an international job and need to leave the country once every two weeks. So we were in the UK while I applied (note - it was my first entry since my old visa expired. I should have switched before it expired but have provided some rationale), but I had to leave again for work duties in the US. 

Now the good news is the CoA came through, but because I applied while on an ETA (as a visitor), it says I shouldn’t leave and they won’t let me back in while the application is pending. Obviously I already left, and this makes planning the move a massive headache with that uncertainty.

Guidance however seems to indicate I can leave and return if I have a family permit (which is what we’ve applied for my son). So what I’m trying to figure out is:

1mavpyc,"Citizenship application - approaching 6 months with no news, no acknowledgement of receipt of application","We're currently waiting on a decision for my wife's citizenship application. We paid the fee and submitted the application on the 18th of January this year, and she attended her biometrics appointment on the 6th of Feb. We had an email from TLSContact on that day that I've attached below. That email says that we should have gotten a confirmation of receipt of the application from UKVI, but that never came.

I emailed UKVI in May asking if there was any issue or if we should have gotten any acknowledgement from them that the application was underway, but just got an automated response. 

The 6 month period ends in a few days, and looking at timeline posts here and elsewhere it seems that most are being processed within 2-3 months. 

So now we're wondering if there's been a mix-up somewhere, and if the application has even been received and processed at all. I'm not sure who to contact, because emails just get an automated response.

The only thing I can think of that would make the application more complicated than normal would be an arrest in her home country that my wife has from 2005 or so - however, we have been honest about that at all times throughout her previous visas and she was granted ILR without issue. 

Any ideas for next steps, an email address that someone will actually read, or what we can do to find out if the application has actually been received?

1makgs9,Student Visa — Application Questions,"Hey everyone.

As of writing this, I have double-checked all of my responses, but I do not feel confident proceeding with the declaration due to some of the sections. I am applying for a Student visa to pursue my Master's education.

Firstly, the travel history section. I have meticulously cross referenced tickets, booking confirmations, etc., to have as accurate of a travel history outline as possible. But not only am I completely missing concrete information from when I was a minor on a Child Student Visa, (I am now applying from within the UK while on a graduate visa, having held a regular Student Visa beforehand). But I'm just generally paranoid about receiving a refusal due to just human error.

With residence, I am just a bit confused about the logistics of technically being resident at two properties at once. Almost exactly a year ago, I became a leaseholder of a property. However, that happened a month before my tenancy at the apartment I was staying at, waiting to be able to move into the purchased property, had ended. Therefore, in August 2024, I was technically a resident at both properties? I say this because my rent, collected on the first of the month, included council tax and bills. So, for all intents and purposes, I was a taxpayer at that rental for the whole of August 2024.

Lastly, the study details section is also confusing me a little. What is the difference between a higher education provider and but with a record of compliance? I have received an unconditional partial scholarship, so do I take it off the course fees information provided? Regarding all the sponsor information, does the university count as my sponsor as it is an internal scholarship?

And lastly, the stupidest question is, what the hell do I put if there is no street number for my university? It is listed everywhere as ""\*\*\* Lane"" That's it. When I search by postcode, the system even omits the street number, then tells me to input something. Do I just put ""0""?

Sorry if I'm overthinking or if some of these questions are ""just Google it"" material. I'm just very paranoid, so I would want to hear from a real person as well.",2025-07-27T11:56:59,beekchang,0,2,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1makgs9/student_visa_application_questions/,['student visa'],"Student Visa — Application Questions Hey everyone.

1mahgjk,Dates for indefinite leave to remain after FLR(M) and days outside the UK,"My wife is coming up on 5 years of spousal visa so we’re preparing for her indefinite leave to remain application.

She was already in the UK on a student visa when applying for the first spousal visa- FLR(M). She applied for the first spousal visa online on 26/07/2020 - biometric appointment was on 07/08/2020 and we were emailed to say it was granted on 21/10/2020. The BRP for that visa had an issue date of  16/10/2020 and expired 16/04/2023 

We applied for the second spousal visa on  22/03/2023 and received an email to say it was granted on 05/04/2024. This BRP had an issue date of 05/04/2023 and has now transferred to an eVisa with an expiry date of 30/10/2025.

I understand you can apply for SET(M) 28 days before the “qualifying date” so my question is - is the qualifying date 16/10/2025 as that’s 5 years after the issue date of the first BRP? If so, we can apply on 20/09/2025. Or do we need to wait until 28 days before the current visa expires (30/10/2025) which would be 02/10/2025? 

Also, during the first visa (in the height of Covid) my wife was back with family in China for 217 consecutive days. She explained the reasons for this in the second visa application and it was approved without issue. She will provide the same explanation with the ILR application. Could it cause issues? As I understand it there is no set maximum time outside the UK for SET(M) and she’s been living with me and working in the UK consistently since then

1mafp8m,UK Visa Experience (Pakistani Applicant in NJ),"Hey all, wanted to share my recent experience applying for a UK visa (standard visitor) as a Pakistani passport holder based legally as a non-immigrant in the U.S. I opted for the regular $179 (not premium) process and booked my biometrics appointment at the ASC center in Elizabeth, NJ – one of the few options available (others were in NY and Philly). Here’s how it went:

**Document Upload (a.k.a. digital pain):** They recommend uploading your documents 24–48 hours before your biometrics appointment. Since mine was right after a public holiday, I made sure to upload everything at least 24 hours ahead. But here’s where the system gets... weird. I had merged a few PDFs (like any sane human would), but the portal kept throwing virus errors or would fail to properly render the files even after accepting them. I had to go through each file *individually*, re-uploading until I could *actually* view it post-upload. Archaic doesn’t even begin to describe it. Pro tip: triple check that your uploads show up properly.

I’d prepped a notarized sponsorship letter, organized my financial docs, and included a utility bill to prove my sponsor’s address. All good there.

**Biometrics Day – ASC Theater Edition:** Application Support Centers are not exactly a beacon of customer service. You check in and sit in this waiting area where, I kid you not, you’re expected to *gradually inch forward* every time someone ahead of you gets called once you are part of the waiting queue. Like musical chairs meets DMV purgatory.

Despite uploading all my documents, they handed me a piece of paper afterward that was vague and honestly kind of misleading — suggesting I *might* still need to send docs via courier. Zero clarity, just vibes.

**Shipping Fun (UPS Edition):** So yes, you *do* need to send in your passport and biometric confirmation page — and in my case, I threw in the visa application form again just to be safe (even though it should already be in their system). Went to UPS and asked for the cheapest 2-day option for both the send and return label. Cost me \~$30, and the staff insisted I include a return envelope, but spoiler: **you don’t need one**. They use their own return packet. Save yourself the confusion.

I mailed it Tuesday, it left Wednesday and arrived at the UK Visa Processing Hub in NY on Thursday, and the decision was made by the following Tuesday, and my letter was dispatched the same day. That's a one-week turnaround post-docs, which honestly surprised me.

**The Result:** The VFS informed me of a “decision made” on my application— but not whether it was approved. That wait for the return delivery was full of suspense. But thankfully, I’d organized my file well and my sponsor had sent all the right documentation, so the visa was granted 🙌

**TL;DR Tips:**

* Upload docs early and check each one actually displays post-upload.
* The portal is clunky — be patient.
* ASC centers are purely functional, don’t expect clarity or assistance. They will refer to UK website which charge money to respond via email.
* Send your passport + biometric confirmation, but no need for a return envelope.
* Use the UPS app to track everything.
* Be overly organized; it helps.
* One final tip - if you aren't taking the premium package, addons such as mobile texts are not really necessary.

Hope this helps someone else going through the same process!

1maeksc,I Don't Have The Official Documents For My First UK Passport Application - Only Scanned Copies,"Hi all – I’m applying for my first UK passport based on my potential claim to citizenship through my British mother (my family lives in Canada, but my mom was able to renew her passport earlier this year with no issues). I’m currently in the UK on a student visa (I only found out after arriving in the UK about this claim to British citizenship through my mother).

The problem is: I don’t have the original documents with me. My official birth certificate, my mother’s birth certificate, and my parents’ marriage certificate are all back home in Canada with my parents. I only have scanned copies at the moment.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Were scanned copies acceptable for your application? Alternatively, my parents can send the originals directly from Canada — but we’d need them returned to *them*, not to me in the UK. I’m moving to a different city in about a month, so it wouldn’t be ideal for the documents to come back to me here.

1madqr2,Potential Issues with Student Visa Application?,"Hi, I’m posting this mostly out of anxiety regarding my student visa application... For context, I'm from a low-risk country, and this is my 2nd student visa for a masters course I’m taking directly after my undergrad (i.e. no gap in between my studies). No contentious visa/travel history.

After my biometrics appointment, I realised I made a few mistakes/did some things that might affect my application(?):

* For self-uploading docs, I did not scan all pages of my passport [as per VFS guidelines](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/ind/en/gbr/supporting-documents), only the pages with my profile information on them. Is this an issue, since the visa centre is currently in possession of my passport anyways?
* MAJOR ONE: I mentioned ""no"" when asked if I've applied for leave to remain in the UK but I just found out that it actually asks if I've applied for visa before which is yes...
* For my UK and travel history, I noted down that I was in the UK for 10 months from Sep 2023 to June 2024, but forgot to mention I was out of the UK for a month in-between: I was in Japan for a holiday (though I did mention this Japan trip in my travel history)
* When uploading my old passport (as it had evidence of my prev UK visa in it), I uploaded two copies—the first time I uploaded, I forgot to add a particular page with some entry stamps, but I couldn’t figure out how to delete it, so uploaded a second corrected copy of my old passport. I labelled them quite clearly, but am not sure if this might confuse the caseworker.
* Also a more minor issue but apart from the important documents (passport, document checklist, TB test) I also uploaded an official student status letter since I thought it would be helpful as proof of my masters course, but now I'm second-guessing and wondering if it might actually slow down the process since it wasn't mandatory?

I’m just wondering how major these issues are and whether they could be detrimental to my visa decision outcome? Particularly worried as I’m scheduled to leave in less than 4 weeks and had opted for standard service. I know I can’t do anything at the minute and should just wait, but it’s tough not to think about it all the time haha… any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)",2025-07-27T04:54:51,Quirky_Survey_479,0,6,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1madqr2/potential_issues_with_student_visa_application/,"['UK visa', 'student visa']","Potential Issues with Student Visa Application?

1mab1gh,Do we have strong enough evidence for Family Visa,"Hi, i have been reading countless stories on this subreddit regarding others experiences but wanted people opinions on how strong of a case my partner and I have for the non-married partner visa route.

Our Story:
We met May 2021, did not start dating until September of 2021. 
I finished Uni in the U.S. May 2022 and started a full time job in U.S. (I had accepted prior to the start of dating and as part of my contract I was obligated to work 2 years for the company 
without having to repay bonuses)

She completed her bachelors in June 2022 and her masters in September 2023, both in UK. She then started work January 2024 and currently makes £30,000 plus commission (meets financial requirement)

During this period of time we saw each-other roughly 4 times a year ranging from a week to over a month. We would split holiday costs, I transferred her airline miles to book flights, and would share expenses when visiting, however no money was transferred.

After completing a little over my  2 years at my company I started a masters program on a student visa in UK (September 2024). We have lived together the full time and shared expenses (have transfers dating back to June 2024 when we started looking for flats). 

I am coming up on finishing my program in September and would like to do family visa if possible to start on my 5 years to ILR (I know I do have graduate visa as an option but would delay ILR)

We will be able to provide letters from family friends, bank statements showing the above mentioned expenses, hotel/plane tickets, and communication records.

Title: Student with Solo Business – Which Bank Statement to Use for UK Visa (6-Day Trip)?

Hi everyone,

I’m a 21-year-old student currently enrolled at a university, and I also run a small solo business. I’m planning a short 6-day trip to the UK and I want to apply for a visitor visa.

I have some questions and would really appreciate advice from those who’ve been through a similar situation or know how the visa process works:

1. Which bank statement should I use for my visa application – my personal account or my business account?
I have both, but most of my money is in the business account since I use it to manage income and expenses.


2. Can my business sponsor my trip?
The business is legally registered under my name. Can I show that the business is covering my travel expenses? If yes, what kind of documents or explanation would be needed to prove this?


3. I have strong ties to my home country (I live with my family and I’m still a full-time student).
Will a short 6-day trip raise any red flags with the visa officer? I plan to return on time and have no intention to overstay.



I want to make sure everything is clear and properly documented before applying. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance 🙏

1ma6hcl,ILR Earliest Application Date,"Hi everyone,

Sorry if this question has already been answered, but I’d really appreciate some clarification on the earliest date I can apply for ILR.

**Background**:  
I arrived in the UK on 26 December 2016 on a Tier 4 visa for a course that started on 9 January 2017 and ended in October 2020. Before the end of the course I managed to find a sponsored job and applied within the country to move to a Tier 2 visa with the following details:

**Tier 2 Visa:**

* COS assigned: 14 July 2020
* Visa application date: 14 July 2020
* Visa granted: 5 October 2020
* BRP valid from: 16 October 2020
* Visa valid until: 30 August 2023

I then extended my stay as a Skilled Worker with these details:

**Skilled Worker Visa:**

* CoS assigned: 26 July 2023
* Visa application date: 1 August 2023
* Visa granted: 8 August 2023
* Visa valid until: 12 September 2026

I’m trying to determine the earliest date I can apply for ILR. According to the [Skilled Worker caseworker guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-caseworker-guidance/skilled-worker-caseworker-guidance-accessible), I need to have spent a continuous 5-year period in the UK (not as a dependant), in any combination of eligible routes, including Skilled Worker.

The guidance also says that, due to COVID-19 disruptions, the time Tier 2 and Skilled Worker applicants spent working while waiting for visa decisions (between 24 January 2020 and 30 June 2021) counts towards the 5-year period, as long as they were in the UK with permission and the application met certain criteria.

**My question:**  
My first job (when I actually started working) began on 17 August 2020—before I received my Tier 2 visa, but during the COVID concession period.

So, does the 5-year period start from 17 August 2020, meaning I could apply for ILR from 17 August 2025? Or do I need to wait until 16 October 2025, when my BRP started?

Has anyone had success applying using the concession? Also, does it make any difference if I opt for priority processing?

1ma0wcy,Can my spouse apply for British citizenship immediately after ILR if I become a citizen during that time?,"Hi all,

I’m hoping to get some clarification or hear from others with similar experience.

I currently hold ILR (settled status) and will be eligible to apply for British citizenship in August 2025.

My wife is on a Skilled Worker visa and is now eligible to apply for ILR based on her own 5-year residency.

We are married and living together in the UK.

As I understand it, spouses of British citizens don’t need to wait the usual 12 months after getting ILR before applying for naturalisation , as long as they’re married to a British citizen on the date they apply for citizenship.

My question:

If my wife gets ILR before I become a British citizen(processing times) , can she still apply for citizenship immediately after I become British and essentially bypass the 12 month wait , or would she still have to wait the full 12 months after ILR?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can shed some light or share their experience.

I’ve also emailed UKVI for official clarification, but hoping to hear how this works in real life too.

1m9zdo1,Skilled Worker Visa – Confused About 4-Year Cap and Settlement Eligibility,"Hey everyone, I’m a bit confused about my situation and was hoping someone could clarify this for me.

I started working in the UK in October 2023 as a cabin crew member under the Skilled Worker visa route. My first visa was granted for 1 year, and then in 2024, it was renewed for 2 years, meaning it now expires in 2026.

At that point in 2026, I’ll be 25 years old and will have spent 3 years in the UK under this visa. I’m currently benefiting from the reduced salary threshold, since I came before April 2024 and was under 26 when I applied.

Now I’m wondering:

When I renew my visa in 2026, will they give me another 2 years, or just 1 year because of the 4-year cap?

If I do get a 2-year renewal until 2028, I’ll be 27 by then — will I still be able to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) at the 5-year mark?

Or will the 4-year rule (for those using the discounted salary) prevent me from staying the full 5 years to get ILR?


Any help or advice would be really appreciated! I’m trying to plan ahead but this rule is a bit confusing.

I’m nearing my 10-year ILR date. As per my calculations and the advise from  others  , I should be eligible to apply during the last week of Feb 2026. Aiming for March 2026 submission only to ensure the exceptional assurance period is safely included.

But there’s a chance I might be made redundant in October this yea (2025)  due to stuff going on at work that's beyond my control. I really don’t want to lose the ILR opportunity after all these years because of something that’s not in my hands and feeling very anxious  (Currently on skilled worker visa valid  till end of 2026) 

If redundancy does happen, what are my options to legally stay in the UK during Nov, Dec, Jan, and up to end of Feb? I know curtailment notices may take time, but what if I get it quickly?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or has suggestions.

1m9cgjl,"British citizenship timing dilemma — trying to meet both 5-year presence and 12-month settled status, but 3 days short","Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate your insights on a British citizenship timing issue.  
I'm currently facing a dilemma between two core requirements that almost—but not quite—align.

# 📌 My situation:

* First arrival in the UK for long-term residence: **12 September 2019**
* **Left the UK: 28 July 2020**  due to COVID-related disruption and the shift to online education
* **Returned: 9 January 2021**
* Have been continuously resident in the UK since
* **Settled status granted: 31 July 2024**

# 🇬🇧 Citizenship requirements I’m navigating:

1. Be **physically present in the UK exactly 5 years before the application date**
2. Have held **settled status for at least 12 months at the time of application**
3. Not have spent more than **450 days outside the UK in the last 5 years**
4. Not have spent more than **90 days outside the UK in the last 12 months**

# ✅ What I meet:

* I plan to apply on **27 July 2025**, and I was **physically present in the UK on 27 July 2020** → ✅ So I meet the **5-year physical presence requirement**
* My **total absences in the last 5 years** = \~**258 days**
* My **absences in the last 12 months** = well under 90 days → ✅ So I meet the **residency and absence conditions**

# ⚠️ What I don’t quite meet:

* My **settled status was granted on 31 July 2024**
* Applying on **27 July 2025** means I fall exactly **3 days short** of the required 12-month period

So:

* If I apply before 28 July → I meet the presence rule, but not the 12-month settled rule
* If I wait for 31 July → I meet the settled rule, but miss the presence requirement (since I left the UK on 28 July 2020)

# 🙏 Why I’m posting:

I may not be in the UK in early 2026, so waiting until January to apply could become practically impossible.  
I really don’t want to lose my chance to apply for citizenship **just because of a 3-day technicality**, especially when I meet all other requirements.  
I’m wondering whether discretion might apply in this case, considering the COVID-related absence and how close the dates are.

# ❓My questions:

* Has anyone successfully applied slightly before completing the 12-month settled status period?
* Would a **cover letter** explaining the COVID-related absence and timing conflict help?
* Or is this simply too risky, and should I wait?

Thanks so much to anyone who can share experience or advice 🙏

Updates: First of all, thank you so much to everyone who took the time to reply — I genuinely appreciate the thoughtful input and guidance.

Let me address the key concerns raised:

**🔹 1. Intention to remain in the UK**  
Yes, I *do* intend to remain in the UK long-term — not just in January 2026, but beyond. I’m currently a PhD student and actively applying for postdoc positions or jobs in industry here. Unfortunately, due to how competitive the job market is, I haven’t secured anything yet. That’s why I mentioned I “might” be abroad temporarily — purely out of necessity, not because I want to leave.

But to be clear:  
✅ My preference is to stay and work in the UK.  
✅ I’m not applying just to “get the passport and leave.”  
✅ In fact, many UK-based roles (both postdoc and industry) explicitly or implicitly favour British citizens, so having citizenship would *help* me stay.

**🔹 2. Why not wait 3 more days?**  
If I wait until I’ve held settled status for 12 full months (31 July 2025), then I no longer meet the **“physical presence in the UK exactly 5 years before”** requirement.  
On **28 July 2020**, I left the UK due to COVID. My university moved fully online, and both my academic department and student accommodation *advised international students to return home*. I came back on **9 January 2021**.

So I’m caught between the two criteria — waiting helps one, but disqualifies the other. I’d rather be upfront about it than gamble or misrepresent anything.

**🔹 3. Continuous residence issue?**  
Thanks for flagging this — I’ve now carefully checked the Home Office guidance. My absence (28 July 2020 – 9 Jan 2021) was **under 180 days**, and COVID-related. I meet the continuous residence rules with no concerns.

**🔹 4. Was my settled status granted after 5 years?**  
Yes. Although my long-term residence started on **12 September 2019**, I had already been in the UK earlier for scientific preparation and internships. I believe the Home Office took this into account when granting my settled status in **July 2024** — I didn’t apply early or under any exceptional clause.",2025-07-25T22:09:33,PuzzleheadedCharge24,14,14,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1m9cgjl/british_citizenship_timing_dilemma_trying_to_meet/,['settled status'],"British citizenship timing dilemma — trying to meet both 5-year presence and 12-month settled status, but 3 days short Hi everyone,

1m9798z,"Spouse visa extension — low salary, savings, few payslips, need advice","Hi everyone, Hope you are all well!

My spouse visa extension (FLR) M is due on **October 14** this year. I’ve had no job income for the last 7 months, but I’ve just started a new job. The contract is fixed but the salary will be **under £18,600 per year**.

I have **£44,000 in savings** held for over 6 months and meet all other requirements for the extension (English, relationship, accommodation, etc).

I’ll only have about **2–3 payslips** by the time I apply, which I know is less than the usual 6 months required.

Also, I’ve had some job opportunities recently but they’ve been “cash in hand” (off the books), so unfortunately that income won’t count for the visa application.

* How strict is the Home Office about having 6 months of payslips?
* Is there anything I can do to strengthen my application with limited payslips?

1m96uxr,citizenship referee declaration forms,"Hi everyone,

I have a few questions about the referee declaration form for citizenship application. My route is 5-year Tier 2 visa → ILR → 1 year

1) After which tab can one download the referee declaration form in the picture?

2) Once I download the form, can I still go back to my application and check/edit things before officially submitting? OR

3) Do I need to pay and submit the application first before I can access the referee form? It means then no checks can be done anymore, I believe.

4) I saw sample declaration forms online (that is, MN1 referee forms). Are all referee forms basically the same or depends on the route to the citizenship application?

5) In the application form itself, there is a question along the lines “How do you know the applicant?” – should this part be written in the referee’s own words (as if they are speaking) or from my perspective (me describing the relationship)? \[I know this sounds a silly question, but so be it.

1m9422m,Traveling Abroad After Course Completion:Student Visa Valid Till Jan 2026 – Confused About Curtailment Risk?,"My situation:
I'm an Indian student who has just completed my postgraduate course in the UK.
My official final results will be released on August 13, after the PAB (Progression and Award Board) meeting.

My current Student visa is valid until Jan 31, 2026.
(CAS ends on Sep 30)
I’m planning a short trip to Serbia from August 18–25 (already booked), 

The confusion: At a recent meeting, my international advisor said that once the PAB confirms my award (on Aug 13), the university may report my course completion to UKVI. If that happens during my travel week, he said there is a risk I might not be allowed back into the UK, because I’m no longer a “student.” He said UKVI could curtail my visa to 60 days from that point.

Now, here’s what I’m trying to clarify:
Is this a common risk or a rare scenario?
If I don’t receive a curtailment letter/email, my visa is still valid, right?
Has anyone actually faced trouble re-entering the UK after course completion, before their visa expiry?
Should I carry any specific documents while re-entering, like a student status letter or final results?

I know that many students finish their course, stay until the end of their visa, and then apply for Graduate Route,sometimes right before expiry. I’ve never personally seen anyone receive a curtailment letter unless there was a serious issue.

1m8s5ko,Spousal Visa Application - Advice Needed (ILR Holder & Graduate Visa),"Hi Reddit,

I have a lawyer consultation booked, but would appreciate some external advice on a pressing issue.

I'm an ILR holder. My partner, who was on a Graduate Visa for 2 years (after his Masters), currently earns £25k. I'm self-employed at £30-31k and completing my self assessment. We've lived together for 1 year and been dating for 2.5 years.

Our intention is to get married, but we've faced significant delays finding a ""Notice of Marriage"" appointment with the council since April, even with priority requests.

* My new salary requirement for ILR will be the [""lower going rate""](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-going-rates-for-eligible-occupations/skilled-worker-visa-going-rates-for-eligible-occupation-codes) since my CoS was issued prior to 2024.

   * Date of BRP issuance: 28/03/2021
   * Date of Entry into the UK: 26/04/2021
   * Date of application: 15/02/2021

* My husband's visa and entry into the country was 2 months after me and he is on a dependent visa. Am I right in assuming that we will need to extend his dependent visa by 2 months, and then apply for ILR once he completes 5 years?

In addition, is the BRP being phased out and the eVisa taking it's place? I'm unclear on the status of that.

I'm a little confused based on the new immigration rules and the switch to digital, I did my biometrics on the 14th of July, however, the switch to digital visas was on the 15th of July and they didn't inform me of this at VFS and they kept my passport, in regard to VFS, I haven't heard anything of when I'll receive my passport and whether or not it'll have the vignette but I have been told in the UKVI email: ""You have also been issued with an eVisa."", does this mean I'll still receive a Vignette, if so, which would I enter on?

In addition, is the BRP being phased out and the eVisa taking it's place? I'm unclear on the status of that.

1m884mb,Skilled worker dependent visa - successful. Timeline/process.,"Hi all,

This is the timeline and process of my skilled worker dependent visa. I got a lot of information from this subreddit which made the process easier. Thank you so much everyone! 

Place: Bangalore, India
Submission date: 28 June 2025
Biometrics date: 7 July 2025
Application forwarded to UK VI: 7 July 2025
Visa successful mail: 9 July 2025
Passport received by courier: 12 July 2025

My husband and I have been in a relationship for over 5.5 years and we got married last November. The first two years we lived together, and then he moved to the UK for his masters and continued to stay there for work.

Most of the documents are self-explanatory.  A few I have explained below.

FinancialTransactions.pdf - A few financial transactions between us. We included transaction statements from both mine and my husband’s bank account. 

PermissionToStay.pdf - My husband’s e visa, share code, old BRP.

Coverletter.pdf - Along with the cover letter explaining our relationship we also included a table (in the same format as the UK visa checklist we get after submitting the application). This table had the list of documents and a brief explanation of what each document contained. 

EvidenceWhyLivedApart.pdf - Payslips from both our companies and my husband’s university transcripts. 

WhatsApp chats - Four screenshots from each month for the entirety of our relationship. 

There’s a 5 MB limit on the VFS portal so split the WhatsApp chats, photos, etc accordingly to meet this limit. Maybe year wise or something. 
——

On the biometric day, I carried only my passport and the VFS appointment letter (along with other documents VFS ask you to bring). I didn’t take the documents I uploaded on the VFS portal.


The VFS self-upload portal closes 24 hours before the biometrics appointment I think. We uploaded it all on Saturday for my Monday morning appointment. 

I am not sure if all of these documents are needed, I just wanted to be on the safer side. Hope this is useful to someone!

Pretty much I applied for my evisa using my BRP and all good I have an Evisa. One day, accidentally wanted to login to my evisa but I tried using my passport because I forgot I did create the evisa using my BRP. It started showing me the same process while applying for an evisa and idk what happened but stupidly I did apply for an evisa again as I was on a rush.

1m7ybfb,Youth Mobility Visa Scheme financial help!,"Hi everyone, I recived an email from UKVI after applying for the YMS visa as a Canadian citizen stating that they require ""Documents, in the applicant's name, to support that you have held funds of GBP 2,530 for a 28- day period (dated within 31 days before the date of application) in line with Appendix Finance."" I have a savings account where I have held money from 18 June to 12 July and I moved the money to my current account and have held over £2530 continously since 12 July to date.

UKVI requires that the funds in a bank account have to be held for at least 28 days. From 18 June to 11 July (I submitted my app on 12 July), it's 24 days. Prior to submitting, I was under the impression that the date you submit your biometrics is when the applicaiton is submitted (as in its sent off to the Home Office for consideration). I had my biometrics appointment on 15 July and 15 July is 28 days of consistently holding funds. When I received the email I realised I was wrong and that the day you submit your application online is considered date of submission. So 18 June to 11 July inclusive is 24 days. I have spoken to my bank who said they will provide me with a bank statement from 17 June to 12 July of my savings account and I am going to get a bank statement from 1 June to 24 July showing that even though I am short of the 28 days by 4 days, even after I submitted my application the funds never fell below £2530 and my bank has agreed to provide me with a letter saying that the funds are above £2530 in my current account (where the money is now) at any point.

I’m looking for some advice or similar experiences regarding my UK visa situation. I had my biometric appointment on 2nd May 2025, and after that, I had my online teams interview with a home office interviewr on 30th June. It’s now the end of July, and I still haven’t received any update or decision.

I understand that some cases take time, especially if they involve additional checks but I’m starting to get anxious now as it’s been over 3 weeks since the interview and nearly 3 months since biometrics.

Has anyone else experienced delays like this after an interview?

Is there a way to follow up without causing issues or delays?

Can I raise a formal inquiry or escalate it somehow?

At what point should I consider contacting my MP or legal help?


Honestly, any suggestions, insights, or even sharing your timeline would really help me feel less alone in this.

1m7ll6w,Anyone get UK Visa with a U.S. 221(g) case still pending?,"Hi everyone,

I applied for a U.S. F-1 student visa in June 2024. During the interview, the visa officer verbally said it was approved. However, later on my visa was held for ""administrative processing"" under section 221(g). It’s now been over a year, and the visa is still pending with no final decision. 

Now I am applying for a UK Student visa where I will be asked to declare any prior visa refusals.

Given that 221(g) isn’t technically a refusal, but does appear as ""Refused"" in U.S. systems, should I select ""Yes"" and explain it, or ""No"" and mention it in additional info, since there's no final refusal decision?

1m7l5ge,Should I register as a sole trader if my EU pre-settled status might be invalid?,"Hi all, I’d appreciate any advice or insights.

tl;dr: I have EU pre-settled status but was out of the UK for 4.5 years (more than the 2-year limit). I’m back now after I got a five-year extension. I want to register as a sole trader and apply for child benefits, but I’m scared this might trigger a Home Office review and revoke my status. 

I currently live in the UK and (on paper) still hold EU pre-settled status. However, here's the issue: I left the UK during COVID and ended up living in a non-EU country for about 4.5 years. My wife was accepted to a UK PhD program and I was granted a five-year extension for my EUSS, so we decided to return.

I’m now trying to register as a sole trader. I started the process but paused when I reached the question: “Did you come to the UK from a non-EU country in the past 12 months?” It felt like a red flag. Also, I no longer live at the same address I used when I first got pre-settled status. I'm nervous that updating this info might cause more issues.

To complicate things, I received - like many others - an email recently saying the Home Office will check whether I’m eligible for *settled* status. A month later, they responded with something vague: they couldn’t determine eligibility.

We’re hoping to apply for child benefits - with no nearby family, that support would really help - but I’m hesitant. I’m worried that completing these forms  might trigger a deeper review or give the authorities the kind of information that will lead to my status being revoked or a bureaucratic nightmare.

Has anyone been in a similar situation - especially someone whose status *should* have lapsed? Did applying for benefits or registering as self-employed cause problems? Or did it quietly go through?

1m7gnoj,Father born in Canada (1930s) to UK-born father - is he British? Can he pass citizenship to me?,"Looking for advice on a complex British citizenship question involving multiple generations and law changes.

**Background:**

* My father was born in Canada in the 1930s
* His father (my grandfather) was born in the UK (Scotland)
* My grandparents were married when my father was born
* My father automatically became a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947 (Canadian Citizenship Act)
* I was born in Canada in the 1960s

**My Questions:**

1. Is my father currently a British citizen? He would have been born as a British subject, then transitioned to CUKC in 1949, but did acquiring Canadian citizenship in 1947 affect his British status?
2. If he is British, can he pass citizenship to me? The current [gov.uk](http://gov.uk) website suggests fathers can only pass citizenship if they were ""born in the UK"" or ""given citizenship in their own right"" - but my father got his British status through his UK-born father, and was born in Canada himself.
3. Were the transmission rules different in the 1960s when I was born? Maybe the current restrictions didn't apply back then?

I've gotten conflicting advice from two UK immigration lawyers - one says it's straightforward (my father is a citizen - go ahead and apply for Passport), the other says it's complicated and requires ""exceptional circumstances."" Of course, the important question for me is, if we can get him a passport, does that help my citizenship case or am I left with Ancestry route for residency?

1m7glyx,Spouse VISA - CASH,"Dear Reddit!

I am preparing to submit a UK Spouse Visa application for my wife to join me in London. At present, we both live together in Germany. As I do not currently have employment in the UK, I am intending to rely on the **cash savings route** to meet the financial requirement.

From my understanding, the current financial threshold is **£88,500**, which must be held in **cash** for a minimum of **six months** prior to the application date.

I am fortunate and currently hold **£100k** within a **Fidelity Stocks and Shares ISA**, invested in a tracker fund across 15 years. I would be grateful if you could confirm whether this ISA, in its current form – would be accepted toward meeting the financial requirement, or whether I am required to:

1. Convert the investment to **cash** within the ISA (without withdrawing it), or
2. **Sell** the ISA assets and transfer the proceeds into a standard bank account and hold them for a further **six months** to qualify.

My preference is to use the existing funds without restarting the six-month holding period, if that is permissible under the current guidance.

3. Has anyone done this method using a Fidelity ISA as 'Cash'? 

\-- 

**Further information:**

On Page 56 / 78 of the document 'Family Migration: - Appendix FM and Appendix HM Armed Forces Minimum income requirement - Published for Home Office staff 12 March 2025' I have the following quote, so I believe using an ISA as cash is ok.

*'For example, in the UK a 'stock and shares' Individual Savings Account (ISA) does meet the definition of a savings account and the funds can be considered as cash savings if all the requirements below are met'*

* the bank / savings account is a current, deposit or investment account
* the account is held is a financial institution regulated by the appropriate regulatory body for the country in which that institution is operating
* regular bank statements are provided
* the statements cover the necessary time period required in the Immigration Rules
* the savings are held in cash (or their cash value is clear)
* the savings can be immediately withdrawn (with or without penalty)
* the funds are under the control of the person and / or their partner for the necessary time period required in the Immigration Rules
* the source of the funds is legal
* the source of the funds has been declared

1m7etm7,UK Spouse visa for less than a year,"Hello. I’m on a skilled worker visa in the UK. I’ve been here since August 2023 and my visa expires on June 2026. I will extend my visa with the same company before it expires for another 3 years. I am getting married soon in September and want to bring my wife to the UK on a spouse visa. 
My question is, when I’m applying the uk gov website says I have to apply for mimimum of 33 months. I’m assuming her visa is going to expire when mine is too. 
But is there a way to reduce the application fee then ? Or is she going to get a visa that extends beyond my own. ? 
And also, the IHS fee. Do I have to pay for only one year or pay all 3 years and wait for their refund ? If my wife gets only a years visa.

1m7egdl,"Waiting for EUSS Family Permit decision — straightforward case, strong ties, but still no update","Hi everyone, I’m feeling really stressed waiting for my EUSS Family Permit decision. My case should be straightforward and strong — I’m an EU citizen, 20 years old (technically under 21), and the child of an EU citizen with settled status in the UK. I technically grew up in the UK and lived there before Brexit but moved away for education as a minor, so I wasn’t fully aware of Brexit implications at the time.

Despite this, I’ve maintained strong, continuous ties to the UK — I’ve been back every summer since 2022, and my family is still settled there. I have provided clear and comprehensive evidence supporting my eligibility, including proof of my family’s settled status, my residency history, and my ongoing connection to the UK.

I submitted all required documents promptly, completed biometrics on the 12th of June, received the ECO email on the 18th of June, and responded quickly to an additional documents request. Given all this, I’m surprised and anxious at the lack of updates, especially since my situation appears to meet all criteria clearly.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? How long was your wait? Any advice or reassurance would mean a lot.

1m7dk0y,Spouse visa path to ILR/Citizenship in marriage with British Citizen vs. ILR holder,"Hi,

I keep hearing about how in the shift from 5y to 10y to citizenship/ILR, Spouse visa won't be affected and will remain a path of 5y.

However, is that the case when the person is married only to a British Citizen, but not if the person is married to a ILR/EUSS holder?

A IRL/EUSS holder can sponsor a Spouse visa ([see GOV](https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa/partner-spouse)), but [this article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/migrate/uk-to-implement-new-visa-and-settlement-rules-for-immigrants-starting-july-22/articleshow/122806762.cms?from=mdr) reads:

>Certain groups are expected to be exempt from the longer settlement timeline:

>– Partners of British citizens

I find that a bit confusing, because it specifies ""British citizens"", not ILR/EUSS holders. 

I know [this pinned](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/) post indicates that Spouse visa won't change from 5y path, but the info on other places is confusing.

1m7c7wz,Unable to find Super Priority slot for my ILR application,"Hi all,

It's been quite stressful for me because I have told my prospective employer that I don't need a work visa from September onwards. My understanding was that I could purchase a Super Priority (SP) slot and get my ILR decision early.

I'm applying for the ILR (10-year route), and have submitted my application. There was only a standard fee available on the gov.uk application portal (the 3029.0 option, no Priority or Super Priority option), so I paid for that. Then I was redirected to TLScontact to book a biometrics appointment. (I am applying within UK). I assumed this was where I could find SP slots; however, I checked at 2 am last night and again at 4 pm today, and none of the locations have SP slots or P slots.

1m75l30,Dependent Visa (Skilled worker) - Unmarried Partner (Inside UK) - Success!,"Hi Everyone,

I wanted to thank everyone for their help. This subreddit has helped us a lot. I am putting down my detailed application timeline and everything we used.

We didn't use solicitors and we put our whole application together in 3 days.

>Application Timeline -

* 1st June 2025 - Application submitted.
* 9th June 2025 - Additional docs requested to prove ""Our genuine and subsisting relationship.""
* 25th June 2025 - Application was approved - but we didn't receive any confirmation mail nor my E-visa was updated. We only found out about it on 21st July.
* 21st July 2025 - Finally my E-visa was updated, but I still haven't received any decision email from UKVI, they are not sure why I didn't receive the email.

>Relationship Timeline -

* Started dating in Jan 2023. I was on student visa and my partner on a SWV.
* In our culture and religion, it is not allowed to live together unless we have introduced each other to our parents, which we did in Dec 2023.
* We moved in together in April 2024.
* We have been living together since.

>Resources we used -

* This is lovely reddit post which we relied heavily on - [(Link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1ifcspc/skilled_worker_unmarried_partner_dependent_visa/)
* Home Office caseworker guidance on assessing genuine relationship - [(Link)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationship-with-a-partner-caseworker-guidance)

>

Application Docs -

* We also added an Index document which makes a caseworker's life easier - it was suggested by a caseworker who previously worked for Home office in an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1033a77/ama_im_a_former_entry_clearance_officer_here_to/). Collating docs and clearly naming/labelling them for uploading helped us be organised. I am adding the Index doc that we uploaded for the caseworker to reference what docs have been uploaded.

Hi Everyone,

I wanted to thank everyone for their help. This subreddit has helped us a lot. I am putting down my detailed application timeline and everything we used.

We didn't use solicitors and we put our whole application together in 3 days.

>Application Timeline -

* 1st June 2025 - Application submitted.
* 9th June 2025 - Additional docs requested to prove ""Our genuine and subsisting relationship.""
* 25th June 2025 - Application was approved - but we didn't receive any confirmation mail nor my E-visa was updated. We only found out about it on 21st July.
* 21st July 2025 - Finally my E-visa was updated, but I still haven't received any decision email from UKVI, they are not sure why I didn't receive the email.

>Relationship Timeline -

* Started dating in Jan 2023. I was on student visa and my partner on a SWV.
* In our culture and religion, it is not allowed to live together unless we have introduced each other to our parents, which we did in Dec 2023.
* We moved in together in April 2024.
* We have been living together since.

>Resources we used -

* This is lovely reddit post which we relied heavily on - [(Link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1ifcspc/skilled_worker_unmarried_partner_dependent_visa/)
* Home Office caseworker guidance on assessing genuine relationship - [(Link)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationship-with-a-partner-caseworker-guidance)

>

Application Docs -

* We also added an Index document which makes a caseworker's life easier - it was suggested by a caseworker who previously worked for Home office in an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1033a77/ama_im_a_former_entry_clearance_officer_here_to/). Collating docs and clearly naming/labelling them for uploading helped us be organised. I am adding the Index doc that we uploaded for the caseworker to reference what docs have been uploaded.

1m72bwb,Urgent help please - UK Family Visitor Visa – Spending Amount & 2-Year Validity Advice,"Hi all,
I’m an Indian national living in the UK on a spouse visa. My husband is a French national with settled status.

We’re applying for a 2-year family visitor visa for my parents in India. They want to visit us for 20 days. My dad is an HR Head earning £800/month, (80,000 INR) has £6,000 savings, and owns a home in India. We’ll provide free accommodation and assist with meals.

Questions:
	1.	Can they apply for a 2-year visa? They have visited once before. 

	2.	In the “how much will you spend in the UK” section – is £5,000 too much? Our solicitor suggested it, but it seems high and reduces their financial buffer.

	3.	If he declares he’ll spend £5,000 for one short trip, could the ECO question how he’d afford future visits in the 2-year visa period? Alternatively, if he declares a more modest, realistic amount (like £2,500–£3,000), would that seem too low?

I'm currently on a UK Student visa (valid until end of Jan 2026) and studying at the uni of Liverpool. My course ends in September 2025. I'm planning to travel to India in December and return by 25th Dec 2025. But I'm concerned about whether it’s safe to travel before applying for the Graduate Route (PSW) visa.

You can only apply for PSW after your university officially confirms course completion.

You must be inside the UK when applying for the PSW.

If I’m in India when that notification happens, I might miss my chance to apply.

1. Wait in the UK until the university confirms to UKVI and I apply for PSW?

1m6ubtl,Will absences less than 180 days delay my ILR application?,"Hi Reddit Community,

I got the global talent visa (GTV) with endorsement from the Royal Academy of Engineering on 20 Aug 2022, entered the UK on 23 Oct 2022 to collect the BRP, and left  the UK on 4 Nov 2022.

1m6swoh,PSA: eVisa and Stamp on passport at immigration,"Just arrived at Gatwick, and the immigration officer at the border control demanded to see the eVisa page (not share code) at the border control. Argued that I didn’t need to show it for my previous entries this year (at least two other times this year) and many other times since the eVisa was introduced. I said that the info should be there on his screen but he insisted saying you still need to show and don’t argue about what they can see. The officer also stamped my passport, which wasn’t done before.

Not sure if there’s any new rules - saw online something about 2 June 2025 where BRP expired on 31/12/24 is no longer accepted, didn’t know that was even the case. But not sure if it’s related, and didn’t find any info on gov UK website.

So just prepare the page just in case. I showed him very quickly and he was just glancing at it, not even checking the details. Not sure what’s the point. I’ve always thought the immigration officer wouldn’t need to see it since they can check in the system, and the requirement was just before boarding since flight companies can’t see the details other than using share code.

I said that the info should be there on his screen but he insisted saying you still need to show and don’t argue about what they can see.

Not sure if there’s any new rules - saw online something about 2 June 2025 where BRP expired on 31/12/24 is no longer accepted, didn’t know that was even the case. But not sure if it’s related, and didn’t find any info on gov UK website.

So just prepare the page just in case. I showed him very quickly and he was just glancing at it, not even checking the details. Not sure what’s the point.

1m6qeb6,Child Naturalisation MN1 Referee,"Hi everyone! 
I am applying for my daughter naturalisation through MN1 Form. I have a question specifically regarding ""Professional Referee"".

My daughter was born in the UK in 2024, I was on a Skilled Visa at that time. Recently I have received my Settlement (ILR) and I want to register my daughter as a British citizen.
I understand for that we need to fill MN1 form, but I am bit confused regarding professional referee.
In MN1 Referee Form it says, if the applicant is a child applying one  referee  should  be  a professional  who has  engaged  with  the  child in  a  professional  capacity,  such  as  a teacher,  health visitor,  social   worker  or minister  of  religion.
However, online there is an extended list of professions which includes accountants, etc. 

My question is it possible to get it signed by someone who is accountant by profession? Currently no health worker is ready to sign the form and share their personal information (passport number, addresses, etc).

1m6pxm9,Graduate Visa to Youth Mobility Scheme Visa ID - Check ID App instead of biometrics appointment? (Canadian),"Hi all, I am a 25yo Canadian working in the UK on a graduate visa that expires in Jan 2026. I am looking to apply to the YMS but to avoid being off work for too long (I dont think they would allow me to be off for very long) I was planning to do my biometrics in Spain (where my partner is from) as it is closer and cheaper than flying back to Canada. However I have been reading that I have to apply from a country I can reside in for more than 6 months, would that rule out Spain and force me to go back to Canada? 

Also, I have read a few posts of people in similar situations as I am but I've not seen anyone mention the seemingly possible option of proving your identity through the UKVI Check ID app? Is this new? Does anyone have any experience with this? Would I possibly be able to apply from Spain through the App? What qualifies someone to prove their identity through the app as opposed to an in-person appointment? I think I used the app when I applied to my graduate visa but obviously that had to be done from within the UK, so it was not an issue for me at the time.

From the YMS Apply page:

""As part of your application, you’ll need to prove your identity. How you do this depends on where you’re from and what type of passport you have.

You’ll either:

* use the ‘UK Immigration: ID Check’ app to scan your identity document - you’ll also create or sign into your UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account
* have your fingerprints and photo (biometric information) taken at a [visa application centre](https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre)

1m6p96b,Will existing Skilled Worker visa holders before 22 July 2025 still qualify for ILR after 5 years?,"Hi everyone,

Today, the UK government published **Statement of Changes: HC 997**, which includes a major update — the new requirement of **10 years** of residence before Skilled Worker visa holders can apply for **Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)**.

* Renew their visas
* Change jobs
* Continue working in roles below RQF Level 6

1m6khcu,Citizenship Certificate,"Hi all,

I’m hoping for some advice or experiences from people who have been through the same mess. Here’s what’s happened to me:

I’ve just been granted British citizenship after living here for years. I paid for a private ceremony which is scheduled very soon. The problem is, the Home Office has mixed up my surname and given name in their records (I think because my most recent travel document from them had the names swapped). All my previous applications such as extension and ILR were done with my name in the correct order, and my solicitor handled them all.

Now, the registry office says my certificate will have the wrong name order unless it’s fixed, but the Home Office told me there are only two options:

1. Go ahead with the ceremony, get the certificate, then send it back for amendment (which could take up to three months).
2. Ask the Home Office to amend it before the ceremony, but this could also take months and would mean delaying everything.

My solicitor wants to charge me a lot extra to deal with the amendment, even though I believe it’s the Home Office’s error, not mine. I’ve already paid thousands over the years for immigration help and I do not want to pay more just for fixing a clerical mistake.

My questions are:

* Has anyone else had this happen?
* If you accepted the wrong certificate and sent it for correction, how long did it take to get the fixed certificate back?
* Is there any way to speed up the amendment, or should I just go ahead with the ceremony and fix it after?
* Did anyone ever get charged by the Home Office for a correction when it was clearly their mistake?

I’m hoping for some advice or experiences from people who have been through the same mess. Here’s what’s happened to me:

I’ve just been granted British citizenship after living here for years. I paid for a private ceremony which is scheduled very soon. The problem is, the Home Office has mixed up my surname and given name in their records (I think because my most recent travel document from them had the names swapped). All my previous applications such as extension and ILR were done with my name in the correct order, and my solicitor handled them all.

Now, the registry office says my certificate will have the wrong name order unless it’s fixed, but the Home Office told me there are only two options:

1. Go ahead with the ceremony, get the certificate, then send it back for amendment (which could take up to three months).
2. Ask the Home Office to amend it before the ceremony, but this could also take months and would mean delaying everything.

My solicitor wants to charge me a lot extra to deal with the amendment, even though I believe it’s the Home Office’s error, not mine. I’ve already paid thousands over the years for immigration help and I do not want to pay more just for fixing a clerical mistake.

My questions are:

* Has anyone else had this happen?
* If you accepted the wrong certificate and sent it for correction, how long did it take to get the fixed certificate back?
* Is there any way to speed up the amendment, or should I just go ahead with the ceremony and fix it after?
* Did anyone ever get charged by the Home Office for a correction when it was clearly their mistake?

This is all very stressful and I’d appreciate any honest advice or timelines from people who have been through it.

1m6kfwf,Applying for a New Visa While on Section 3C Leave in the UK - Is It Allowed?,"I’m currently switching from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa. Before I got my job offer, I submitted a student visa extension to avoid any visa gaps and to stay legally in the UK. That application is still pending, so I’m now under Section 3C leave.

The company sponsoring my Skilled Worker visa has advised me not to submit the Skilled Worker application yet because my previous application is still undecided. They mentioned they need to amend my visa end date based on the outcome of the current application and strongly recommended waiting until that decision is made.

Has anyone been in a similar situation where they had to wait for a pending visa decision before submitting a new one under a different route? Is this standard advice while under Section 3C leave?

I initially thought you are allowed to apply for a new visa while under Section 3C, and that doing so would automatically cancel the pending one.

Also, just to clarify: I submitted the current visa application before my previous visa expired, so I’m lawfully in the UK under Section 3C.

1m6fkx6,EUSS as durable partner - additional evidence requested,"Hey folks,
I’m following up on a post I made a few months ago and could really use some advice or shared experiences.

Quick context: I have settled status under the EUSS, and my partner (a Turkish national) applied for the EUSS under the durable partner route this past May (she's already in the UK, graduate visa). We've been together since November 2018.

Relationship timeline in a nutshell:

Nov 2018 – Sept 2019: Lived together in the UK while studying

Sept 2019 – mid-2022: Long-distance relationship due to visa expiry + COVID travel issues

Since mid-2022: Living together again in the UK under her current visa (student + graduate, expiring in Nov).


While we did cohabit back in 2018–2019, the evidence is unfortunately a bit thin. We’ve got some photos, a few Amazon deliveries to our shared address, and statements from family. After 2022, we’ve got solid documentation: a joint tenancy, photos, shared bills, etc.

We submitted a detailed relationship timeline, travel history, photos from over the years and the current joint tenancy agreement. We also explained the lack of cohabitation was due to work/study commitments.

Today we got an email from the Home Office requesting more evidence, specifically:

**Evidence of your relationship to your unmarried (durable) partner**

- Evidence that your relationship existed for at least 2 years by 31 December 2020 
- Evidence that your relationship continues to exist on the date you applied 

**Examples of evidence to demonstrate a durable relationship**

bank statements or utility bills in joint names at the same address 

residential mortgage statement or tenancy agreement in joint names 

official correspondence that links you at the same address
 
Evidence of joint finances, business ventures or commitments for at least 2 years by 31 December 2020: 

tax returns, business contracts or investments 

Evidence of joint responsibility for a child by 31 December 2020: 

the child’s birth certificate which names both parents 

a custody agreement showing that you’re living together and sharing parental responsibility 

I’m a bit surprised about the request to prove our relationship is still ongoing, since we included photos from this year and our current joint tenancy agreement. I plan to add statements from our joint bank account and utility bills as further proof, but it does make me wonder how carefully our original evidence was reviewed…

As for the pre-2020 evidence, it's honestly not clear to me if they want something that can put clearer dates on the relationship or if they're unhappy with the kind of evidence we provided (the wording doesn't seem to question the durability? But then again, maybe it's standard).

We also explained clearly that we don’t have additional formal documents from that time.


Does anyone have advice on how best to structure the cover letter that will accompany our response to this request?

Also, are there any other types of informal or supporting evidence we might be overlooking that could strengthen our case?

Appreciate any insights. Thanks in advance!

P.S. I know we'd qualify for a family visa but the EUSS is overall better and cheaper, so we're exploring this option first",2025-07-22T14:28:43,Sith92,0,3,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1m6fkx6/euss_as_durable_partner_additional_evidence/,"['settled status', 'EUSS']","EUSS as durable partner - additional evidence requested Hey folks,

1m6c2z6,UK ILR Timing (Global Talent visa),"
Hi everyone, I’d appreciate some guidance.

I’m on a Global Talent Visa, granted on 6 Jan 2023 for 3 years. However, I entered the UK at the end of March 2023, so my 3-year continuous residence will only complete around 25 March 2026.

My visa expires on 6 Jan 2026, which is about 2 years and 9 months after I arrived.

I understand that ILR applications can be submitted up to 28 days early, but even then, I won’t be eligible until late February 2026, which is after my visa expires.

My question is:

Can I still apply for ILR just before my visa expires (in Dec 2025 or early Jan 2026)?
Or do I need to apply for a short extension to bridge the gap, and then apply for ILR once I complete 3 full years of UK residence?

1m69lg5,Accommodation/Visa - Student Visa,"Hi everyone,

I am an international student.

I’ve paid for my university accommodation and digitally signed the contract, but in the system it still shows as “provisional” so I haven’t received an official confirmation letter yet. 

I reached out to the uni, and they said many students in this situation just use the university’s general address for visa purposes.

This confused me a bit. If I’ve already paid and signed the contract, can i use the accommodation address instead of the school?

And is it really fine to just list the uni’s main address when applying for the visa? Has anyone else done this without issues?

I’ve paid for my university accommodation and digitally signed the contract, but in the system it still shows as “provisional” so I haven’t received an official confirmation letter yet. 

I reached out to the uni, and they said many students in this situation just use the university’s general address for visa purposes.

This confused me a bit. If I’ve already paid and signed the contract, can i use the accommodation address instead of the school?

And is it really fine to just list the uni’s main address when applying for the visa? Has anyone else done this without issues?

I’m applying for a UK Student Visa for Sept 2025 intake. Would love some help on what precautions I should take in my case.

Here’s my situation:

🔹 I’m married – husband will stay back in India while I go to the UK.
🔹 I’m taking an education loan (joint with my husband) – will be submitting sanction letter, stamp, signature, and bank letterhead.
🔹 I had a tourist visa refusal recently (applied to visit a friend in July with my husband – it was the only time he had leave; we didn’t explain finances properly back then, our mistake).
🔹 Now, I’m applying as a genuine student – I’ve got admits from multiple unis

What precautions should I take now for the student visa to avoid rejection?

Especially worried about:
	•	Will the loan be seen as a negative since it’s jointly with spouse who’s not traveling?
	•	Does being married but traveling alone raise red flags?
	•	How do I clarify the tourist visa refusal clearly without sounding defensive?

Any help or sample formats would be awesome.

1m5rnbf,Advice needed: Applying for ILR,"Hi all, 

History of my stay: 
Sep 2015 - June 2016 Foundation degree (tier 4 - student visa)
Sep 2016 - Aug 2019 completed a uni degree (tier 4 - student visa)
Sep 2019 - Feb 2020 stayed as a tourist
Feb 2020 - May 2020 Travelled home, Covid hit and flights were all cancelled 
May 2020 Entered the UK with youth mobility scheme visa (tier 5)
April 2022 Skilled worker visa
Feb 2023 - current BNO visa

The UK's long residence immigration rules allow individuals who have lived in the UK legally for 10 years to apply for ILR. 

With BNO visa, after you’ve lived in the UK for 5 years, you can apply to live in the UK permanently. I am aware the time i’ve spent in this country under Youth Mobility Scheme visa and Student visa does not count towards the 5 years. 

But given that I first arrived in the UK in 2015, almost a decade ago, does it mean i’m eligible to apply for ILR in Sep 2025?

1m5por2,Skilled Worker Dependant Visa ILR Eligibility — Which Start Date Counts,"Hi friends,

I’m hoping someone here can help clarify a confusing situation for my family. I’m currently on a Skilled Worker visa valid from **13/07/2022 to 14/07/2027**. My wife and daughter are on Skilled Worker Dependant visas with the same BRP validity dates: **13/07/2022 to 14/07/2027**.

Due to the pandemic and high flight costs at the time, they joined me in the UK later than expected. Here’s the timeline:

* **Visa start date on BRP:** 13/07/2022
* **Passport vignette entry date:** 01/09/2022
* **Actual date of arrival in the UK:** 05/10/2022

We didn’t realize at the time that delayed entry could impact future ILR eligibility.

My question is: **For their ILR application, which date is considered the start of their 5-year qualifying residence — the BRP start date (13/07/2022), the vignette date (01/09/2022), or their physical arrival date (05/10/2022)?**

We’re really hoping to avoid applying for an extension just to cover a few extra months, as the cost is significant and it only grants another 3 years. But if their qualifying period only begins from the date they physically entered the UK, it looks like we’ll have no choice.

Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!

1m5o6h3,ILR Eligibility - do I need a SWV extension?,"Hi all, looking for some advice regarding ILR timing under the Skilled Worker route.

Here are my details:
	•	Skilled Worker visa valid until: 13 July 2028
	•	BRP issued: 10 August 2023
	•	Entry clearance vignette valid from: 15 August 2023
	•	I entered the UK shortly after (within a few days of 15 August 2023)

As I understand it, I’ll be eligible to apply for ILR 28 days before completing 5 years of continuous residence, which would be around 18 July 2028.

However, my visa expires on 13 July 2028, which is 5 days before I hit the 5-year point (so annoying!)

I’ve read conflicting information online about when the 5-year clock starts, some say it’s from the visa issue date, others say from actual UK entry. I understand it usually starts from the later of your entry clearance grant or your actual entry date (assuming you enter within 180 days), which for me would be around 15 August 2023.

My employer has a policy that they only support ILR applications once your visa is within 6 months of expiry.
	1.	Will I need to apply for a Skilled Worker visa extension just to cover the short gap before I become ILR-eligible?
	2.	If so, is it normal for employers to issue a CoS for a short extension period (like 1 month), or do they usually do a full year?
	3.	Any risk with ILR if my visa expires just before the 5-year mark?

* If I switch to the GTV under the “exceptional promise” route now, can I apply for ILR after 3 years *combined* on GTV and SKV?
* Since I switched to SKV in Dec 2023, I would need the GTV to last until Dec 2026. However, my current job contract ends in July 2026. Can I apply for a GTV that ends in Dec 2026, even though that’s beyond the contract end date?

* Currently working as a postdoc (3-year contract ending July 2026) at a UK university; started in July 2023
* Switched from the Graduate Visa to the Skilled Worker Visa (SKV) and received the new visa in December 2023

**Questions:**

* If I switch to the GTV under the “exceptional promise” route now, can I apply for ILR after 3 years *combined* on GTV and SKV?
* Since I switched to SKV in Dec 2023, I would need the GTV to last until Dec 2026. However, my current job contract ends in July 2026. Can I apply for a GTV that ends in Dec 2026, even though that’s beyond the contract end date?

**Checklist I’m preparing:**

* Requesting 3 endorsement letters: 2 from professors and 1 from a senior lecturer (Dr, not professor) 
* CV
* Personal statement

1m5j7zg,ILR Eligibility Help - Dependant Visa,"Hello All,

I need some clarity regarding whether I should apply for a two-year or three-year dependant visa extension for my family.

I will be eligible to apply for ILR in August 2027 (assuming the 5-year rule remains unchanged). I have already applied for an extension to my visa, and my Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) end date is 1st November 2027.

My wife and son received their visa vignette/decision letter on 14th October 2022 and arrived in the UK on 6th January 2023. I am now preparing to apply for an extension to their visas.

Given the above — particularly their visa issue date (14th October 2022), arrival date (6th January 2023), and the intended new visa end date (1st November 2027) — would they meet the 5-year residency requirement to apply for ILR at the same time as me in August 2027? Or would they need another visa extension after November 2027 to complete their qualifying period?

1m5io23,Not able to update eVisa details,"Hi,
I got my visa on 18th June and added the visa to my UKVI account through the UK Immigration ID Check application. I have 2 questions.

1. That means my passport is liked to my eVisa right? As I scanned my passport through the app.

2. When I go to see if it's liked together, i don't see the ""Personal Details"" section on my ""Update eVisa"" page. So I'm not able to update anything else other than my login info and addresses.

I am able to generate a share code but I'm just wondering why I don't have that section. Is it because I got my visa after BRPs where no longer issued? Since I don't need to link my passport to my UKVI account that isn't associated with any BRB?
But still I am not able to update my photo and I see others have that ""Personal Details"" section.


I just want to know if anyone else is facing the same issue. I just want to upgrade the photo on my eVisa because I went bald recently and im travelling in 1 month and I look very different now like a bar of soap.

1m5idba,ILR after SWV - immediate citizenship if married to UK citizen?,"Hi all, I have spoken to two immigration lawyers who gave me conflicting advice, so looking for anyone in my situation who has had success in this area. 

I will be applying for ILR next month after 5 years on a SWV. However, I am also married to a British citizen (for 6 years) but I have never been on a spousal visa (my spouse does not make the income requirement, hence my reliance on a SWV). 

One lawyer told me I can immediately apply for British citizenship as soon as I get my ILR due to being married to a Brit. Another lawyer told me no, I'd have to wait the 12 months, because you can't ""switch streams"" - the immediate application is only for those who got their ILR through a spousal visa route.

1m5icv8,Withdrawing Graduate application and applying as Spouse - timing issue?,"I made an in country application for the Graduate visa on the date my Student visa permission ended. 

My partner and I are intending to marry shortly, and decided it makes more sense to apply for the Spouse visa instead.

However, if I were to submit a Spouse visa application immediately after withdrawing my Graduate application, will the date of application be considered as the date of my initial application? Obviously my marriage certificate will be dated later. And if so, I wouldn't be considered eligible for the Spouse visa at the time of application.

1m5i9u1,Wizzair evisa check in issues,"Hi,

I’m Romanian and my wife is Chinese. We both live in the UK, and she has a UK spouse visa. We’re planning to travel to Romania for a visit, but we’re having issues with the online check-in process on the Wizzair app.

When she tries to check in online, the system asks for a visa or residence permit. If she enters the Romanian Visa, we get an error saying “Visa is not valid for entry to the United Kingdom”. But if she enters her passport number which is tied to the UK evisa, it says “Visa is not valid for entry to Romania.” The system doesn’t allow entering multiple visas or permits, so we’re stuck. I know BRPs are not valid anymore so all we have is a share code from the evisa. 

Does anyone know how to get around this? Would it be possible for me to check in online just for myself and then check her in at the airport with all the required documents?

Any advice from people who’ve had a similar experience would be greatly appreciated.

1m5gkv9,Spouse visa renewal,"Hello, I’m currently on a spouse visa which expires at the end of October. My husband has a settlement status and we have a 19 months old baby with a British passport.

1m5bf0r,Spouse visa might not last — can I switch to Skilled Worker once I start an RQF course?,"

Post:
Hey folks,
I’m on a spouse visa right now, but things aren’t going well with my partner and honestly, the relationship could end any time. I’m trying to figure out how to stay in the UK on my own if that happens.

Here’s where I’m at:

I’ve got a full-time job in a role that’s on the Skilled Worker occupation list

My salary is £31k, which is under the £38,700 threshold

My company is a licensed sponsor and willing to give me a CoS

I’m currently looking to start an RQF-recognised course (level 3 or higher)


I know there’s a lower salary requirement (£30,960) if you’re studying, a recent grad, or under 26, etc.

So my question is:
Once I start the course, can I apply for the Skilled Worker visa right away using the lower threshold?
Or do I need to finish the course first to qualify as a “recent graduate”?

Would really appreciate any advice. Just trying to stay ahead in case things go south at home.

1m57f5e,Worried: Could this one line in my gap justification letter affect my UK student visa?,"Hey everyone,
I recently submitted my UK student visa application for an MSc in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. I didn’t receive a credibility interview (which I’ve read usually means no major red flags), but I’m a bit anxious about one sentence I included in my gap justification letter.

Here’s the line:

> “I believe the insights and skills I have gained during these intervals will contribute meaningfully to my academic journey and career trajectory in the UK.”

Now I’m worried it might be interpreted as a desire to settle permanently or stay long-term, which I know UKVI is cautious about under the “genuine student” requirement.

For context:

My application is otherwise strong (CAS, financials, solid academic background, clear gap explanation).

I haven’t been called for an interview.

I’ve read that career goals are fine as long as they don’t suggest intent to breach visa conditions.

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through a similar situation or has insights into how UKVI might view such a statement. Could this line alone realistically cause a rejection?

1m513fq,Ilr application for child dependent 21F  (i am dependent on a skilled worker)absences for university outside of the country — over 180 days abroad due to uni(i come back during holidays),"Hi everyone,

I am a 21 year old female born in Zimbabwe 

I’d really appreciate some advice regarding my ILR eligibility as a Skilled Worker child dependant.

I’ve lived in the UK since October 2021 on a dependant visa. I’m currently 21 years old, and still fully financially and emotionally dependent on my parents, who are the main Skilled Worker visa holders.

I’m approaching the 5-year continuous residence period required for ILR. However, I’ll be studying at university abroad during the fifth year of that period, and my total absences during that year will come to almost 8 months — so well over the 180-day limit.

My questions are:
	•	Will this break the continuous residence requirement for ILR as a dependant?
	•	Since I’m studying abroad (not settling elsewhere), still fully dependent, and intend to return and live with my parents — can this be considered a compelling reason or be subject to discretion?
	•	Are there specific documents I should prepare now to help strengthen my future application?
	•	Has anyone successfully applied in a similar situation or know of cases where studying abroad was accepted?

Any guidance, advice, or official references would be really appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!",2025-07-20T21:47:46,Alive-Class5613,0,1,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1m513fq/ilr_application_for_child_dependent_21f_i_am/,['ILR'],"Ilr application for child dependent 21F  (i am dependent on a skilled worker)absences for university outside of the country — over 180 days abroad due to uni(i come back during holidays) Hi everyone,

1m50fl8,UK Spouse Visa Extension Application - Urgent Question,"My partner is currently applying for a spouse visa extension. Unfortunately due to a diplomatic problem between Peru and Mexico in June 2024, she had a problem entering Mexico and was refused entry as visa requirements changed weeks before travel.

1m4y0kt,Unmarried Partner Visa - Not proving 2 years of living together,"Hello, I am writing this post to know the chance of my partner getting approved a UK family visa as an unmarried partner. 

I am a French with a Settled Status / Indefinite Leave to Remain. She is Turkish with her Graduate visa expiring in November 2025. 

We have been together since December 2022 when i was already working on a full time job and she was finishing her master. 

After she finished her master in end of August 2023 (which coincided with the end of her rental contract with her flatmate), she moved all her belongings to my flat share (with one other flatmate). 

From September 2023 to February 2025, she was in between Turkey, where she has been learning about her family business, and London where she was coming to visit and live with me for long periods. During that time, she was not on our tenancy agreement, and the only evidences of living together during that time are bank statements which were at the same address, and a testimony from our flatmate during that period.

After going to Turkey together in October 2024 and having met all with all her relatives, her family got comfortable about us living together and accepted that we could move formally in a flat together. just the two of us. 

In February 2025, we managed to find a place to move in together and this time we have all solid proofs showing that we are well living together (tenancy agreement, utility bills, etc...)

We plan to apply for the unmarried partner visa, on the following basis : 
	- we have been in a serious relationship for more than 2 years and 8 months
	- we have not been able to live together just the two of us before February 2025 because her family was not comfortable with the idea, and she was in between Turkey and London during that period
	- as soon as we got the approval from her family about us moving together the two of us and settle in London. We went looking for a flat and acted the move in February 2025
	- We now have all the evidences that we live together in London and have a similar lifestyle than a married couple

Would you have a view on this application, and advice for it to be successfully approved ?
If you believe that it will be rejected, could you please provide info on what's missing in our case ? 

This is a very stressful time for us, and I saw how much this community was brought together around this topic ❤️

1m4vzxf,My pre-settled status got auto-extended question,"Hi everyone,

I’m an EU citizen who lived in the UK before Brexit and was granted **pre-settled status**. I left the UK during **COVID in 2020** due to personal and financial reasons, and I’ve been back in my country ever since.

I know that to qualify for **settled status or to keep your pre-settled status**, you need 5 years of **continuous residence (6 months outside in a 12-month circle)**, and I’ve been out of the UK for more than **2 years**, which I thought would break that continuity.

But just recently (in **2025**), I saw that my **pre-settled status was automatically extended until 2030**. I didn’t apply for this — it just updated on its own. Now I’m confused. I assumed I had lost my rights, but does this mean I still have a chance to return?

I’d like to **make plans to return**, but I need to be sure about what I’m returning to. Sadly, the **Home Office hasn’t been very helpful** or clear about what the extension means in cases like mine.

1m4rcax,Couldn't Attend Graduation due to UK Visa Refusal.,"Hello everyone,

I hope you're all doing well.

I'm reaching out to better understand the reasons for my UK Visitor Visa refusal and to seek your advice on how I can improve my application next time.

For context:  
I applied from Qatar with a Sudanese passport to attend my graduation ceremony in Newcastle, England, on **July 14, 2025** (which has already passed). I planned to stay in the UK from **July 10 to July 18**—a total of 8 days.

https://preview.redd.it/smaubv5dp1ef1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f439a86a4c0597bbf308d8516084cc80896775c

https://preview.redd.it/39a195jfp1ef1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1771ff1063e70bf33e4f8fc30e831eedc853c239

From what I understand, the refusal was based on the following points:

**1. Additional Income Evidence:**  
The letter stated:  
*“The documents provided do not demonstrate that you are in receipt of the above additional income.”*  
*“The documents you have provided do not demonstrate any corroborative link between deposits and your stated additional income.”*

In my application, I indicated that I receive **19,200 QAR per year** in additional income (which is **1,600 QAR per month** for 12 months). The online application did not allow me to input a monthly amount, only an annual figure, so I entered the total.  
However, this money is sent to me informally by my father each month as a form of support, without any official contract or agreement. It doesn’t appear as a lump sum in either my bank statement or his, but it’s consistent support from him out of generosity. I understand this may have caused confusion.

**2. Financial Sponsorship and Intent to Return:**  
Another point mentioned:  
*“You state that your father will be paying 20,000 QAR (£3,976) towards the cost of your visit. While I take that into account in assessing your proposed maintenance and accommodation in the UK, this is only one aspect of the visitor rules, and this sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit.”*

I'm unsure what is meant by ""only one aspect of the visitor rules.""  
While I’m currently doing an internship and have a modest income, my father is financially capable of covering the entire trip, which is why I provided his bank statement. I hoped that would be sufficient to prove financial support.

I hope you're all doing well.

I'm reaching out to better understand the reasons for my UK Visitor Visa refusal and to seek your advice on how I can improve my application next time.

For context:  
I applied from Qatar with a Sudanese passport to attend my graduation ceremony in Newcastle, England, on **July 14, 2025** (which has already passed). I planned to stay in the UK from **July 10 to July 18**—a total of 8 days.

https://preview.redd.it/smaubv5dp1ef1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f439a86a4c0597bbf308d8516084cc80896775c

From what I understand, the refusal was based on the following points:

**1. Additional Income Evidence:**  
The letter stated:  
*“The documents provided do not demonstrate that you are in receipt of the above additional income.”*  
*“The documents you have provided do not demonstrate any corroborative link between deposits and your stated additional income.”*

In my application, I indicated that I receive **19,200 QAR per year** in additional income (which is **1,600 QAR per month** for 12 months). The online application did not allow me to input a monthly amount, only an annual figure, so I entered the total.  
However, this money is sent to me informally by my father each month as a form of support, without any official contract or agreement. It doesn’t appear as a lump sum in either my bank statement or his, but it’s consistent support from him out of generosity. I understand this may have caused confusion.

**2. Financial Sponsorship and Intent to Return:**  
Another point mentioned:  
*“You state that your father will be paying 20,000 QAR (£3,976) towards the cost of your visit. While I take that into account in assessing your proposed maintenance and accommodation in the UK, this is only one aspect of the visitor rules, and this sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit.”*

I'm unsure what is meant by ""only one aspect of the visitor rules.""  
While I’m currently doing an internship and have a modest income, my father is financially capable of covering the entire trip, which is why I provided his bank statement. I hoped that would be sufficient to prove financial support.

**3. Personal and Economic Circumstances / Ties to Home Country:**  
The refusal also stated:  
*“You do not have any dependents in your country of residence, do not appear to own any property, and the documents you have submitted do not demonstrate any investments or similar assets.”*  
*“Given this, I am not satisfied that you have substantial ties outside the UK to ensure you will leave at the end of your proposed visit.”*

1m4n7i4,Traveling with a passport that cannot be linked to the eVisa + expired BRP,"Hi all, I really need some advice.

I'm due to travel in two weeks, but I'm facing a complicated situation with my immigration documents. My BRP (Biometric Residence Permit) expired on **31/12/2024**, and I understand that BRPs have been phased out and replaced by the eVisa system. However, my expired BRP is still the document associated with my UKVI eVisa account.

I do have **valid immigration status until December 2027**, and I can generate a **share code** from my eVisa account that confirms this. The problem is that I can't add my **passport** to my eVisa account because of a **name mismatch** (my correct name does not match what is on the MRV).

UKVI has instructed me to send my **physical passport by mail** to resolve this, but with such a short timeframe before my travel, this is not feasible. I'm now seriously concerned about whether I will face issues **re-entering the UK** after my trip.

To summarise:

* BRP expired 31/12/2024
* eVisa is valid until Dec 2027
* Can generate a valid share code confirming permission to stay
* Cannot link my passport due to name mismatch
* Cannot send passport by mail in time to fix this

Has anyone faced something similar? Will the expired BRP cause problems at the border even if my share code confirms I can stay until 2027? Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

1m4mcsl,Extending student visa inside UK - financial and other documents,"Hi everyone,

  
So I have just graduated with my undergrad degree from a UK university and hold an offer and CAS for a masters degree at the same university. I am applying to extend my visa from inside the UK.

I have applied and got my appointment this week. Now the document checklist I was given only requires two things: my passport and permission from my financial sponsor. Which is all good.

  
But I am now worried, because they have asked for nothing else. I have lived in the UK since 2021 completing my bachelor's degree and the site says that if I have been living here for more than 12 months under a valid visa then I don't need to provide financial proof. I have travelled in and out of the country over the past 12 months but I am presuming that I qualify for this anyway?

  
However, I CAN provide proof and my parents are concerned, thinking that I might as well provide the documents whether or not they asked for it to not risk any delays or issues....

My question is: is submitting additional documents a bad idea? And can someone suggest whether I just leave it out as I qualify for the exemption...?

1m4iza4,Passport not returned after visa refusal – can I collect it in person from VFS Sofia?,"me and my partner applied for the UK visa through VFS global in Sofia, Bulgaria. we had our biometrics appointment and gave them our passports and then on july 17 we got a refusal through the UKVI portal.

when we applied, we chose courier return (not “keep my passport while applying”) and gave them our current address. but we haven’t gotten any email or tracking info from VFS since the refusal. we don’t even know if the passports were sent yet.

the problem is that VFS Sofia only works 3 thursdays a month except the last one (meaning this thursday july 24 is the last day they are working before we have to leave) and it’s super hard to reach them — they don’t answer emails or calls. also our rental ends on august 1, and we need to leave the EU right after, so we need to get our passports asap.

we’re thinking of going there in person on the next thursday they’re open, but we’re not sure if they’re allowed to give us the passports if we picked courier return during the application.

1m427qn,Spouse Visa Route ILR Application - Cohabitation Question,"Hi all - I've started my wife's ILR application, which I'm hoping to submit for next weekend.

1m3uev9,Are EUSS applications made before July 16th judged according to old or new absence rules?,"I'm wondering what ""effective July 16th"" means for the new absence rules – does it mean it applies to any applications being reviewed from July 16th onwards, or for any application *submitted* from July 16th onward?

So I check all the boxes, but it might take more scrutiny to prove.

1m3r1w7,"Realistically, when would I be able to apply for citizenship in my case? From ILR","
Hello all! 

First time posting here, It shouldn’t go against the timeline rule I hope. I’ll try and be concise.

First moved to the UK in 2014

Undergraduate degree from 2015-2018 in UK

Continued living/working/studying in UK from 2018-2021

PG Certificate - wasn’t able to finish my masters - from 2020-2022 - technically it’s 2021 but I had to relocate to Italy due to Covid-related issues however, with the extenuating circumstances included my HEAR, it says that the course lasted until 2022.

Now this is the conundrum - in August 2021 I had relocate to Italy as I said before. I returned to the UK in June 2024 with pre settled status to start a new job (I’ve been a full-time employee since). My pre settled was converted to settled (ILR) in November 2024.

With this in mind - when potentially thinking of appplying for citizenship - am I right in thinking that the continuous 5 years of residence (in addition to the 1 year of settled status) would be taken into account from June 2024?

Would any of my pre 2024 years, before the Aug 2021-Jun 2024 gap, so 2014-first half of 2021 “valid”, so to speak? 

Apologies in advance if this has got information gaps - anyone who’d be willing to answer and give their guidance is appreciated and I can provide further details that might clarify the situation. 

I’m aware that the first step might be to get all my travel records in place!

1m3i5s5,UK Visa Approved but No Passport Update — VFS Global (US) Communication Issues,"Hi everyone,

I’m a **Colombian citizen living in the U.S.**, and I recently went through the **UK Standard Visitor Visa** process via **VFS Global (USA)**. I paid for the **priority (fast-track) service** due to an urgent upcoming work trip. Just sharing my experience in case it helps others — or at least raises awareness about some of the issues.

The first problem happened when I received an unexpected **$99 invoice** from [**noreply@elavon.com**]() for “Document Upload Assistance.” It was billed under only my **second last name**, even though my full application included both last names. The email wasn’t clear, and I got suspicious. I contacted **UKVI directly**, and they told me I didn’t need to pay anything extra. Turns out, **I actually** ***did*** **need to pay it**, or my supporting documents wouldn’t be uploaded. Confusing and frustrating.

Then, after receiving notice that my visa had been approved, I **emailed VFS on June 28** asking if I needed to include a new prepaid label for passport return. **No one ever replied** — just an auto-generated ticket number (G-04019403). I followed up multiple times with no actual help.

On **July 16**, I got a text saying my visa application was dispatched via **UPS**, even though I had enclosed a **FedEx prepaid return label**. I had no tracking info and didn’t know which courier they actually used. Turns out, they used their own **UPS security pack** from the original passport retrieval (which I had already paid for earlier).

Finally, my **passport arrived on July 18** with the visa stamped — but with **no tracking, no communication, and no confirmation** until the moment it showed up.

If you’re applying from the U.S., just be aware:

* **VFS Global has no working customer service phone line**
* **UKVI can’t help with VFS processing in the U.S.**
* **Communication is minimal to nonexistent**
* Even if you pay for priority, there’s still a lot of waiting and uncertainty

Keep records of everything, be persistent, and prepare for delays.

1m39sok,Complaint reply on visitor,"Hi all,

I received a response to the complaint I filed regarding the rejection of my UK Visitor Visa. It appears the decision-maker misunderstood my financial situation — they compared my current payslips to the income reported in last year’s ITR, without considering the timing of my job change.

I switched jobs in July last year and received a significant salary hike. Since ITRs reflect income earned between April and March, my 2024–25 ITR wouldn’t fully capture my new salary. Logically, this shouldn’t have been an issue.

I did receive an email reply, and after reviewing some older Reddit posts, I noticed others received similar emails that ultimately led to their visa decisions being overturned. Those emails, however, explicitly mentioned phrases like ""upholding your complaint"" or ""overturned,"" which are missing from my response.

Does anyone know what this might mean in my case?

1m34yzm,Skilled Worker Visa Fee for Temporary Shortage List,"Hi all,

I have seen the announcement on immigration rules changes on the Home Office website 

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-immigration-reforms-delivered-to-restore-order-and-control

It mentions the following: ""Workers in occupations on the temporary shortage list will no longer be able to bring dependants and will not be permitted salary and visa fee discounts""

I checked statement of changes of immigration rules and it does not contain any mentions of visa fees.
UK Visa fees page last updated on 1st of July and contains 'old' discounted fees

1m2eavo,UK visit visa advice after refusal,"Hello. 

Hope everyone is fine. Last year i applied for my father for my graduation ceremony. Along with his application i attached his bank statement and employment letter.

The visa was refused on the grounds that;

1) my father bank statement had a 6000-7000 deposit marked as family support, the decision said this amount was not justified.

2) that the applicant did mention that he has a wife and one dependent son but, no evidence was attached to prove this.

Thus the visa was refused on grounds of being a genuine visitor and ties to home country.

Since the decision came a bit late, my father said he dont want to apply again as he wouldn’t be able to make it for my graduation.

——-

Now i want to apply for him again, to come in summers to spend some vacations with me.

This time along with employment letter and bank statement, i will be attaching his assets (property)details other assets like cars ownerships etc, tax details, marriage certificate, birth certificate and his office rent details etc.

I want to ask, if those will be enough or i need to provide any more evidence? Also will they still question the 6000-7000 pounds as it has been more than 10 months that it has been in his account.

My father passport is from Pakistan and he has only once travel to dubai on his passport.

1m2czrl,Decision email never Received - E visa not updated - anyone experienced this?,"Hi all,

I applied for a Dependant visa from within the UK using priority service. After completing biometrics at the end of June, I didn’t receive a decision. UKVI escalated my case, and I was told via email on 9 July that the decision was sent by email on 30 June.

However, I’ve never received any decision letter not in my inbox, junk folder, UKVI account, or by post. My eVisa still shows my old immigration status, with the standard message about staying in the UK while awaiting a decision.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

- UKVI escalation (twice) – most recent said “the appropriate team has been notified.”
- Filed a formal UKVI complaint. 
- Got my MP involved – they’ve contacted the MP Helpline and marked it as urgent.

Despite all this, I’ve still received no formal outcome or update. This is now affecting time-sensitive plans.

- Has anyone experienced something similar where UKVI claimed to have sent a decision but nothing was received?

- Did you eventually receive the decision? Was a reissue triggered, or did they admit it hadn’t been sent at all?

- And if you involved your MP, how did that process go? Did it help get things moving or get a proper response?

Also wondering if anyone has tried linking their application number (UAN) to their UKVI account to refresh their eVisa, and whether that helped.

Thanks in advance — I’m under a lot of stress and just trying to figure out what’s next. Hearing how others navigated this would mean a lot.

1m2ctry,Just Passed the Life in the UK Test - 2025,"Hi everyone,

This is just a post about my ""Life in the UK"" Test experience that I passed yesterday.

I booked my test with eVisa by getting a share code. I had already taken my share code like a month ago and hadn’t saved that share code as a PDF or screenshot. They asked me if I had it, and I said no. They asked me to get another share code. After I showed them the new share code, they let me into the room, and another guy was able to see my previous shared code on the system and told me I wouldn’t need a new one because previous one is still valid.

I had brought my passport with me just in case, but they didn’t even check or look at it. But they do check whether the photo from the share code - evisa system matches with me or not.

The first 4 questions are sample questions, and the rest are the actual test questions. Generally, it is very quick. I took the test in Birmingham ->me going into the exam center, taking the exam, and going out took like 20 minutes max. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

My advice for whoever will take that exam is—I don’t know if I can share the link here—but if you google ""Life in the UK Test Summary and Notes"" on the Scribd com website, there is a summary note uploaded by Danial. I highly recommend you check that.

my strategy:

First, I read the book and printed out those notes and started to memorise. It’s not about how much you study in my opinion.

1m28tud,Skilled Worker ILR - Urgent Advice Needed – Sponsor Shutting Down Before I'm Eligible,"Hi everyone,  
I'm currently on a Skilled Worker visa in the UK and need some urgent advice regarding my ILR eligibility.

**My background:**

* Entered the UK on a **Tier 4 Student Visa** on **18 Oct 2016** (valid until June 2020)
* Started working for my first employer in **April 2020**, but my first Skilled Worker (Tier 2) application was **refused** in **April 2020** due to a salary issue
* Submitted a new application and was **granted a Skilled Worker visa on 25 Sept 2020**
* Switched to a new sponsor in **August 2022**, and my current visa is valid **until 15 Sept 2025**

**My issue:**  
To apply for ILR under the 5-year Skilled Worker route, I understand I can apply **28 days before** completing the full 5 years which means **from 28 August 2025**.

The **problem is**, my current employer (my sponsor) is shutting down in **July**, and I may not be employed/sponsored at the point of applying.

I have no gaps in my employment or leave conditions since Sept 2020, and I’ve passed all visa checks and conditions. But:

**Will I still be eligible to apply for ILR if I’m unemployed by the time I reach the 28 August 2025 mark?**  
**Would being without a sponsor for a few weeks (before applying) break my continuous lawful stay?**  
I was working during COVID while awaiting a visa decision  is any of that time counted?  
I’m planning to take the **Life in the UK test on 29 August 2025**, then submit my ILR application straight after.

Any advice or similar experiences would be massively appreciated. I’m trying to explore any legal/ethical options before time runs out.

Thanks so much in advance

1m27b33,Article 8 - Application Advice,"I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with Article 8 - Right to Family Life applications? I know they are supposed to be very difficult but I think it is my only option at the moment.

I don't want to go into ridiculous detail so I'll try to keep it succinct. As other's have said in other forums, immigrations don't always seem to get it right. I consulted with one before and she wasn't very useful. She basically tried to scare us to hire her and got things wrong (maybe intentionally). Though I have never practiced, I have a law degree so have been researching myself but want to see if other people have insight.

I am British, with no other cultural influence. My parents are British and so on going back to before there were records. Just stating this to say I have no other country connections through heritage. My wife is American, she only has a US passport. We met when we were both working as teachers in Asia about 15 years ago and we have been married for 10 years. We moved to other 3rd party countries as it was easier than living in the UK and neither of us wanted to live in the USA. In the last country we lived in together, we ended up having children, they are now 3 and 6. Both have British passports. - So we can easily demonstrate that our relationship is real.

I was made redundant from my job unexpectedly where I was earning over £50k a year in the Middle East. Because of the high cost of living in that country, we decided to leave as soon as possible. So our leaving was done in an emergency fashion and would not have been how we wanted to do it. So we are now in the UK, myself and the kids on our British passports and my wife as a tourist. She is staying with us but has not started living in the UK in any way that would go against her visa. Her visa is over half way through now.

We are currently living with my mum, rent free for as long as needed with our children.  - So can show we have accommodation.

Our intention was to use Category B for the financial requirement and then I would get a job that met the requirements in the UK, my wife would briefly return to the US to apply and then come back on the spousal visa. However, despite my attempts to find a job, it is taking considerably longer than expected. I have applied for about 60 jobs, from that I've had two 15 minute interviews and 2 full interviews and got nothing. Ghosting people is crazy here. I am still actively applying and have potentials but the process is so slow in the UK, in each case that led to interview from application to interview alone took about 6 weeks. Another job I recently applied for would not start until December which is after her visa expires. - So basically, I am currently failing to meet financial requirement and even if something comes up sooner, it's still getting too close to her having to leave. If she has to leave, there's no telling how long she would then need to be away for as it might take so long to start in a role that the ability use Category B expires.

My arguments are this: 

Primary: It is in the best interest of the children.

My children are both British citizens and so have the right to live in the UK. Our daughter is 3 and very attached to her mum. She has settled well into the UK since we arrived in March and enjoys being around our family for the first time. Our son is 6 and has a considerable speech delay and suspected autism though we could not get decent support for him where we were living. He has started school here and is about to complete his second term. The school is helping us get a proper diagnosis but again, it's a lengthy process. However, being here is benefiting him greatly, he is now getting the support he needs, and the improvement has been really comforting. Though the kids are technically dual nationality, we never got them American passports.

Secondary: Insurmountable odds

The second argument is that we can't afford to leave the UK as a family. It cost us almost everything we had to clear our debts where we were and get to the UK, and I had to borrow money from my family to do it. We no longer have residency or employment in the country we left and there are no third party countries we can move to now we have children. The only other connection to another country is the US. 

However, we cannot move to the US either. I mean in all honesty, we do not want to move there but even if we did, we couldn't. Firstly, we would have to get the kids US passports which would be costly. Second, I could not go, part of the sponsorship requirements is that the sponsor is resident in America which she is not and has not been for 15 years. She doesn't even maintain a bank account there. Third,  we would have nowhere to live there. My wife is estranged from her mother, and hasn't seen her father since she was a child. She has siblings but none that could provide us with accommodation or support while getting set up.

Tertiary arguments:   
\- The ability to not meet the financial requirements is only temporary. I am still actively looking for employment. I have two masters degrees and almost 20 years experience in the education field though I am not QTS qualified. My wife also have over 15 years experience in education, has a masters degree and an PGCEi though not QTS.  
\- Zero cost to the tax payer. We are still willing to pay NHS fees and other fees and we are not claiming any kind of benefits or universal credit. My wife has no mental or health issues either underlying or preexisting.  
\- We will both end up in the workforce as tax payers.  
\- Though my son is currently in mainstream school at tax payer cost, he is a British citizen and would be entitled to it even if my wife wasn't here.  
\- We would still transition over to a spouse visa once we are able.  
\- We have enough money and family support to sustain ourselves.  
\- If my wife did have to leave, it would still not be possible for us to follow her and I would no longer be able to apply for employment as there would be no one to act as their primary care. Though my mum is healthy, she is still 68 and it would be unreasonable to expect her to act as a complete replacement for their mum. This means, I would have to start claiming benefits as a single parent.  
\- My wife is Latina heritage. Under the current US administration, this means a genuine risk of detainment for no reason. Also, because we had colleagues from Gaza, we have shown sympathy for Palestinian (not Hamas) citizens on social media which is still enough to get you arrested in the US at the moment. So there is a fear of detainment again.

Sorry, I really sucked at being succinct. Any feedback is appreciated. I'm mostly unsure of how to structure it. I have read through the case law and understand the leading cases which have read positively but obviously this was never the way I thought I would have to do this.

This means, I would have to start claiming benefits as a single parent.  
\- My wife is Latina heritage. Under the current US administration, this means a genuine risk of detainment for no reason. Also, because we had colleagues from Gaza, we have shown sympathy for Palestinian (not Hamas) citizens on social media which is still enough to get you arrested in the US at the moment. So there is a fear of detainment again.

Since posting the above, we've managed to get married (yay!), which I believe will greatly aid us in proving our relationship is genuine but now I've got a few more questions which have been bothering me.

1. Will I be able to fill the visa application on behalf of my partner (she will be outside of the UK at the time - Poland, while I will be in the UK) ?

2. I've managed to get my notice period shortened at my current job which will result in a smaller pay on this months payslip and I will be starting my new job mid next month which will also take 2 weeks out of my new UK payslip. Could this have any impact on proving the financial capability to support my partner. I've done this to have more time to take care of formalities before flying out to the UK.

3. Could I use my mothers address on the visa (2 bed flat - currently occupied by her and my younger brother who is a minor) with me and my wife this would make 4 of us. I just want her to be with me ASAP and I'm not sure how long will it take me to rent a house for us - eg. I've rang an agency today about a property posted 1 day ago and the viewing queue is already full which has concerned me.

4. I do recall someone referencing a handbook which served as a guide as to what documents are considered what tier, but for the love of me I can't find it on the UK gov website. I just wonder about the required format of the documents. So far we've got our marriage certificate, earnings statement from previous employer, my PL payslips for the 01/25 - 06/25 period, my PIT for last tax year which is the equivalent of P45 in the UK - All translated by a sworn translator here in Poland and stamped by him, offer letter from the current company based in the UK stating my salary. I also plan on extracting a bank statement from my bank showing all the transfers made by my partner to my account (this will be in english - PDF fromat.

Again, I would appreciate any comments. Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation - or I'm just being overly anxious as I've really got a lot going at the moment.

1m24vcu,MN1 application,"Hi everyone, hope you are well. 

I'm applying for British citizenship for my stepson (MN1 application under section 3(1)). He’s a minor and has been living in the UK since January 2024 (so about 1 year and 7 months).

His mother is now a British citizen (recently naturalised)
I (the stepfather) have Settled Status (ILR)
He has also settled status since June past year. 
His biological father is not involved at all, and hasn’t been since birth
He lives with us full time and is attending school in the UK

My questions are:

1. Can we apply for citizenship (MN1) even though he hasn’t completed 2 or 3 years of residence in the UK?

The Home Office guide says 2 years is normally expected, but it's a discretionary application — so I’m wondering if our case would be acceptable with less than 2 years, since everything else is in place.


2. Regarding the referees:

The guidelines say the referees must have known the child for at least 3 years.

Since he recently arrived in the UK, no professional here has known him that long.

Can we use a professional referee from the Philippines (like his old teacher or doctor) who’s known him for over 3 years?

For the second referee, we could use a British citizen who knows him now (a teacher or neighbour), but they wouldn’t meet the 3-year rule.

Would this be acceptable if we explain the situation in a cover letter?

1m24gtn,Partner (USA) marrying and living with me (UK) - how?,"Hi everyone,

Me and my partner are trying to navigate all things immigration and visa related to try and live together but we're at the early stages and getting very confused and worried.

We're very committed to each other and fully intend to marry and live together as soon as we can. I'm a UK citizen, living in Scotland all my life, she's from the United States.

Our main concerns are the financial/income requirements and the fees as we are both in pretty low-paying jobs and the incredibly high financial barrier seems near impossible for us to reach. We're also not sure of the best plan of action for which visa to apply for if we want to get married as soon as possible.

1m23tiw,Employer name on Payslip does not match original CoS,"Hello, bit of a complex problem.

  
I'm on a skilled worker visa and have been sponsored by a company for the past 2 years (I'm the first and only person they sponsor so they have nfi about the rules). About a year ago they wanted to move all employees from the parent company to a subsidiary, they could NOT do this for me as it would require the subsidiary to get a sponsorship licence and for me to re-apply for the visa under the subsidiary (this was explicitly stated by Home Office to them). 

So I have remained an employee of the parent company, but all my payslips and P60s have the subsidiary name on them. I raised this with payroll and they have said I am still employed by the parent company but I'm being paid by the subsidiary. This seems illegal to me, and I also think this will affect my ILR application if/when I apply next year, as the subsidiary name does not match the CoS. I will say the names are very similar, eg.

1m22i7v,Employer switch question," I am currently on a skilled worker visa which is still valid until December 2025.

I would have liked to continue with my old employer, hand in a 2-month notice, while looking for accommodation close to the new one.

1m20sn1,ILR Eligibility Question,"Timeline Equation:

🧮 Trying to work out if I’m eligible for ILR based on my time in the UK. Here’s my visa journey:

2019–2021: Skilled Worker Visa (18 months)  
→ Returned home for 10 months  
2022–2023: Student Visa (1 year)  
2023–Present: Graduate Visa → Applied for Skilled Worker Visa again

So my equation looks like:

ILR time = 18 months (Skilled Worker) + [TBD New Skilled Worker duration]
Gap = 10 months outside the UK
Note: I know time on a Student Visa doesn’t count.

❓Does the 18 months from my earlier Skilled Worker Visa still count towards the 5-year ILR requirement, or does the 10-month gap reset everything?

Appreciate any insights from folks who’ve navigated similar timelines 🙏

So my equation looks like:

ILR time = 18 months (Skilled Worker) + [TBD New Skilled Worker duration]
Gap = 10 months outside the UK
Note: I know time on a Student Visa doesn’t count.

❓Does the 18 months from my earlier Skilled Worker Visa still count towards the 5-year ILR requirement, or does the 10-month gap reset everything?

Appreciate any insights from folks who’ve navigated similar timelines 🙏

1m1d6po,Pre-settled status to settled status new rules,"Hey guys, I just read about this new rule:

5.15 However, stakeholders have highlighted some confusion on the part of pre-settled status holders regarding permitted absences from the UK, which may have led some to inadvertently break their continuous residence in the UK (and thereby cease to be eligible for settled status) by exceeding the permitted absence(s) from the UK. To simplify the assessment of continuous residence, these changes enable a pre-settled status holder to be granted settled status where they have been resident in the UK for at least 30 months in total in the most recent 60-month period. This can be any 30 months within that 60-month period.

1m1bv27,Pre-settled to settled after divorce (and the retained rights of residency),"Hi everyone, my first Reddit post here. Appreciate if anyone can shed some light…

I divorced my ex partner on Nov 2023. I was granted the pre-settled status through them on Sep 2020 as they’re an EU citizen. We were married for more than 3 years, lived together in the UK for 3 years and divorce happened when the two of us were still living here.
At the time of the divorce the research I did pointed out that I had retained rights of residency and that I should just wait until it was time to apply for my settled and provide documents to support that.
Now that it’s almost time to apply for the settled I have been gathering documents but research has changed.
Apparently I now would have to tell the home office I got divorced (which did not come up at any point on my research back in 2023) which will trigger the 60 days for me to change my status or leave the UK, then apply for the retained rights of residency that can take up to 6 months to review, and then Re-apply for the the pre-settled?
I thought the retained rights of residency for these cases on the pre-settlement were something a person automatically has if all requirements are met, not something we have to apply for?
And how would the timelines work if I only have 60 days to change my visa if the review of the next step (retained rights residency) can take up to 6 months?
All this information seem very conflicting to me. I tried looking for legal advice but the office said they can’t help me and now I’m trying to find another place.
I just wanted to know what the step by step process is so I can do it, as currently I’m relying on scrambled information across multiple websites.

I’m also freaking out that in light of everything I am overstating my visa and the settled will be denied now 😭

I found this thread that shows exactly my situation, but replies are from 2 years ago so I’m afraid things have changed https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1892sv9/retained_rights_of_residence_what_happens_to_a/

1m17iez,Long term permanent residence - current validity and options,"Hi all,


Wonder if I can get some straight answers and support on here, as it was brought to my attention that rules have changed in recent times.

Facts:

-EU national

-I have been living in the UK since June 2008, been a student 2008-2017 (2 undergrads and a master)

-have worked part time for most of my studentship

-have worked full time for the same company since graduation, so 2017-present

-have obtained Permanent Residence in 2019 (blue card one), with the intention of going for the UK passport. Have passed the Life in UK test, but never took it further

-own a house in the UK since Dec 2019 (not sure if it matters)

-mother and sister obtained full citizenship in 2008

-never received any benefits or the like, and always paid my taxes, so no HMRC problems

Questions:
Recently I was told that the Permanent Residence is no longer a valid document. Is this true?
What are my options now, as I see the deadline for settled/pre-settled status has passed?

I am annoyed and feel a bit stupid of getting in this position as was told during the early days of Brexit that I don't need to go for settled status as the Permanent Residence status trumps it.

1m144bv,EUSS caseworker guidance changes,"Question regarding the new rules which come in effect today. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.

Will an applicant still have to meet the minimum 6 months in 12 months to be considered eligible for Settled?

I'm a bit confused by the updated EUSS caseworker guidance.

On page 172 the continuous qualifying period of residency is still defined as at least 6 months in a 12 month period.

""Completing a continuous qualifying period of residence also generally means that the applicant has not been absent from the UK and Islands (or, where applicable, the 
UK) for more than 6 months in total (in a single period of absence or more than one)  in any given 12-month period, throughout the period of residence relied upon by the 
applicant.""

There are however scenarios on page 183 which shows that the new 30 month rule will be used at least for travel data checks.

I'm not trained in reading this properly and it's 6AM😅 so there's probably something I'm seeing wrong.

1m0wvtw,Need advice: Naturalisation from pre-settled vs Settled Status confusion,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone can help me figure this out.

I first came to the UK in November 2019, but had to leave after a month due to personal reasons. I planned to come back soon, but then COVID travel restrictions hit. I finally returned in August 2020, and I’ve been living continuously in the UK since then, with NIN records for each month.

Originally, I was planning to apply for Settled Status in November 2024, but I was advised to wait until August 2025 just to be safe. Now with the continuous residence rules changing from [today](https://freemovement.org.uk/changes-to-the-absence-rules-for-eu-settlement-scheme/#Why_the_generous_change_in_approach), it looks like I was actually eligible for Settled Status from November 2024.

Here’s my dilemma:

* Should I apply for Naturalisation directly in November 2025 from Pre-Settled Status (since I’ve had 5 years of continuous residence + 1 year extra on pre-settled status)? 

OR

* Should I convert my Pre-Settled Status to Settled Status now, and then wait another 12 months before applying for Naturalisation (since you usually need to hold Settled Status for 12 months before applying)?

I’m not sure if anyone has successfully applied for Naturalisation directly from Pre-Settled Status, especially with the new rules. Any advice or experiences would be really appreciated!

1m0qs0a,Fiance visa for long distance couple,"My partner (Russian) and I (British) have been in a long distance relatinship for a little over a year and a half. We are about to meet in person for the first time at the end of this month.

However, one of the lawyers we consulted with told us that we could get away with not meeting in person at all before applying, because we had very good excuses as to why traveling and meeting in person is difficult for us (limited finances, my disabilities, the current situation in Russia and the fact that we are a same sex couple).

So as per this, I’m relying on date of decision. I am planning to do biometric in August end so that by the time of decision, I will be legally eligible.

I am bit confused if this plan will work?

1m0ovkt,"SWV - role at risk for redundancy… few options, need advice!","Hello people,

I’m a US citizen currently on a Skilled Worker (Tier 2) visa in the UK, and I’ve just been told my role is at risk for redundancy. I’ve been in the UK since Nov 2020 (student visa for 1.5 years -> grad scheme for 1.5 years -> skilled worker for ~2 years), and been with my current employer for 3.5 years.

It wasn’t company wide, but a few other roles have been affected. I’m the only one on sponsorship however. 

I believe my sponsorship will expire in December 2025. 

Here’s my current situation:
- I work in Ops/Product. Will probably be looking for roles in this remit, especially junior PM. 
- I’ll be on 2 months’ garden leave (paid as normal)
- My visa is tied to my current employer (they are the sponsor)
- There may be a potential internal fixed term role (in a different department) I could move into. It’s not confirmed though. And it would be technically a regressive step backwards in development and salary. 

I’m trying to get clarity and advice on:
1. how does the 60 day grace period work? I’m seeing it can take months after the Home Office is notified to even get the letter, is that still true? 

I’m just nervous on the newer immigration policies put forth by the government recently. The market’s already really tough, I’m anxious about my chances as needing a sponsorship. 

2. How early should I disclose to new/prospective employers that I need a sponsorship (early in interview?) 

3. Any advice re that internal FTC role? Part of me wants to just dive into the job search and fully focus on finding my new product role, but the other part wants the security that would come w staying (at the expensive of an ego hit and slight reduction in pay.. probably £5k reduction). This could be refused though btw. 

4. Any general advice from people who’ve navigated redundancy while on a Skilled Worker visa?

I’ve built a life here and want to stay. I was hoping to even try to make it for ILTR. I have friends for life here, and built some really strong professional connections that are already v happy to help me network. I’m just really hoping I can figure out a path forward that’s realistic. And a junior PM requiring a sponsorship in this market for roughly the same salary feels daunting. 😰

Any advice or insights from people who’ve been through something similar would mean a lot.

Thanks so much ❤️

Part of me wants to just dive into the job search and fully focus on finding my new product role, but the other part wants the security that would come w staying (at the expensive of an ego hit and slight reduction in pay.. probably £5k reduction). This could be refused though btw. 

4. Any general advice from people who’ve navigated redundancy while on a Skilled Worker visa?

I’ve built a life here and want to stay. I was hoping to even try to make it for ILTR. I have friends for life here, and built some really strong professional connections that are already v happy to help me network. I’m just really hoping I can figure out a path forward that’s realistic. And a junior PM requiring a sponsorship in this market for roughly the same salary feels daunting. 😰

Any advice or insights from people who’ve been through something similar would mean a lot.

Thanks so much ❤️

Approved - 30 July, about 2 hours after my follow up

Sponsor returning to the UK. We are married but interestingly they processed it as a partner visa instead.

Supplied tenancy agreements, photos, family register, statement from applicant, financial statement from sponsor hand holding the ECO, and all the required financial docs. I didn’t give them references from previous jobs or anything like family and friend references

I entered some stuff wrong in the application and just corrected it with a letter when I submitted the documents. I believe the paid enquiry does help speed things up if a decision has been made. If you do one, you can reply to the previous email you received and ask for an update.

* My partner is currently in the UK and has been since April and is leaving in Aug.
* Me and my partner got married October 2024

We have travel evidence for all of this, along with our marriage certificate and have written a cover letter to outline the relationship. Will this be enough if not what else should we look to provide?

1md451t,Approved! Unmarried Partner Visa - Priority - Outside UK,"The wait is finally over!! Thank you to everyone on this sub who me and my partner have been lurking on for the past 6 months hehe. The approval posts and detailed application processes are especially helpful considering a non-typical partner visa route (as opposed to fiancé/spouse visas).

**Overview of Relationship**

* **Sponsor**: British Citizen
* **Applicant**: Malaysian Citizen
* **Length of Relationship**: Just over four years
* **Cohabitation**: Yes (January 2023 - October 2023)

**Context:** I lived in the UK from 2016-2023, first on student visas then a graduate visa in which I was working in London for 2 years. Unfortunately, I couldn't manage to secure a sponsored role which led to us doing long distance for 1.5 years. During this time, my partner and I would travel back and forth 2-3 times a year either to Malaysia (him) or to the UK (me) and decided this year to proceed with the unmarried partner visa (as we believe that we meet the relationship requirements but want to save up more before we tie the knot officially).

1mcmu4u,Spouse visa renewal - he’s horrible to me can he switch to parent visa instead?,"He’s horrible to me and never treated me with love and respect as a wife a should be treated since the very start - it’s been almost five years,

Since the renewal is close he’s pretending to be a husband and act affection I know deep down it’s due to the visa.

I’m raising a child with him but basically alone, he’s always out, hardly works, I finance most things, food, clothes, items for the house, shopping, rent, deposit for a better place, I work and like a crazy woman try to work from home and look after my baby simultaneously and then spending so much on childcare because he doesn’t work enough I have to pay full childcare. I’m exhausted, I’m hurting, I’m angry, but what hurts most is seeing my child go through the same neglect I went through my whole marriage,

My baby loves his dad and babbles dada all day waiting for him to wake up but he sleeps in till midday and then when he’s out waits for him to come home but he comes when baby is asleep,

It’s a tough life, I can’t snatch my baby’s right of having a dad in his life however little he does but I don’t want to extend the spouse visa because there is no relation, this marriage has done nothing but hurt me, it’s better to be alone than married and alone? It’s the biggest pain and now I have a baby

Is it wrong of me to tell him to go down the parent visa route? He will call me bad things regardless but I feel the parent visa will force him to step up as a dad as you have to prove your responsibility and involvement in your child’s life and I don’t want to tolerate less than the bare minimum for my child.

1mclso9,How long can my fiancée stay in the U.K. on a tourist visa without negatively influencing future spouse visa application?,"I have been with my partner for 4 years - she’s a Russian citizen living in Russia and I’m an Irish citizen living in the U.K.

We’ve both recently graduated from university and I’ve got a well-paid job secured in London starting in October. We’re planning to get married in Ireland in December 2025, and then apply for a Spouse Visa in the U.K. in March 2026, when I’ve been working for 6 months and can therefore supply all my payslips, proving that I’ll be able to support both of us living in London together.

However, since we’ve been pursuing our relationship in long distance for the past few years, she’s keen to come to the U.K. to live with me as soon as possible. As such, our plan was to first apply for a tourist visa in October. Since the U.K. gives tourist visas for 6 months, she could feasibly live with me from October-March on a tourist visa, then return to Russia while we wait for the spouse visa application to be processed.

In reality, we’re aware that if she stayed in the U.K. for the full 6 months on a tourist visa, there would likely be questions asked when she goes to apply for the spouse visa after. We want to know how long she could realistically stay in the U.K. (3 weeks? 3 months?) over the course of October-March on her tourist visa without this leading to problems down the road when applying for a spouse visa. In her tourist visa application she’s writing that she only plans to stay for 2 weeks, since it’s unlikely to be approved if she applies for longer than that (again, I haven’t started working yet, so can’t prove that I have the means to support her during her stay).

1mcdz5m,Student finance denied for my husband on a spouse visa - is this right?,"Hi everyone,

My husband recently arrived in the UK on a spouse visa (I have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme). He's starting a teacher training course (PGCE) this September, and we applied for Student Finance to cover the tuition fees only — not for maintenance or living costs.

The application has been rejected on the grounds that he hasn't been living in the UK for 3 years prior to the start of the course. However, I was under the impression that spouses of British citizens or people with settled/pre-settled status are exempt from the 3-year residency rule, provided they came to the UK to live together permanently — which is exactly our case.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?
Are we right to appeal this decision?
Any tips on what to include in the appeal or how to phrase it?

1mcbgzx,ILR - some work questions,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently approaching the final stage of my 5-year route to settlement in the UK. This is my last visa application for Leave to Remain, after which I'll be eligible to apply for British citizenship.   
I'm currently on a spouse visa.

I’d really appreciate some advice regarding the financial requirement, as our work situation has changed since my last application, for both myself and my husband.

  
About me:

I work part-time and usually take on overtime, but recently there have been issues with overtime availability. I understand that I need to provide the last 6 months of payslips, but since my salary varies, I'm concerned that UKVI will calculate my annual salary based on the lowest payslip within that period.

If that's the case, my income might fall below the £18,600 threshold (please correct me if I’m wrong).

If my income alone isn’t enough, I would like to combine it with my husband’s income.   
However, his situation is quite complex:

He works in an industry that has gone through major changes in recent years. He doesn't have a permanent contract like he used to, most of his work is on short-term contracts, lasting a month or two, sometimes only a few weeks, often with gaps in between.

Hi salary on this work varies from £60-£65k.   
Obviously he can provide all contracts and payslips, and based on our calculations, his annual income likely exceeds £18,600, but it's spread across different employers throughout the year.



My first question is:

Am I right in thinking that I can submit my 6 months of payslips and his 12 months of payslips from different employers, even though his work is not continuous? (the longest gap was 3-4 weeks)  
Or do we both need to meet the financial requirement under the same evidence category?

Additionally:

We have a mortgage on a property we bought 2 years ago, would this be considered a helpful supporting factor?

We also have some savings, although they’re under £16,000, can this still help in any way?

Final question:

Given the instability in my husband’s industry, would it be acceptable for him to include a cover letter explaining the situation and providing context? (strikes in the USA caused issues globally)  
Or would that potentially harm the application?

I would be really grateful for any advice or clarification, we just want to make sure we do everything right without having to make some sort of appeal.",2025-07-29T13:29:22,Space_Donkey_2000,2,5,spousevisauk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpouseVisaUk/comments/1mcbgzx/ilr_some_work_questions/,"['spouse visa', 'ILR']","ILR - some work questions Hi everyone,

1mcaaq7,Question about new job/pay calculation,"Hi all 

I had a question about new job and pay for the spouse visa application ~ 

In my current job I earn enough to meet the income requirement for the spouse visa application, my base pay is lower than the income requirement but I make up the rest through monthly bonuses. 

I am due to be made redundant soon, but am hoping to be in a new job that does meet the income requirement at the base pay level. 

My question is about how being in the new job will affect making an application: 

- I know I would need to show that my new job meets the income requirement, are they also going to ask for the previous 12 months of payslips to show my income was at the correct level? 

- Does income from any redundancy payments, bonuses, etc all count towards my income in the past 12 months? 

- Can I simply wait until I’ve been in the new job for 6 months and then we apply then and provide 6 months of payslips? 

Any input would be much appreciated!

- Can I simply wait until I’ve been in the new job for 6 months and then we apply then and provide 6 months of payslips? 

Any input would be much appreciated!

Many thanks!

1mc4jfw,UK Spouse Visa (Priority) Approved,"
Hey everyone, hope you're all doing well!

After days of anticipation, I’m happy to share that my Spouse Visa (Priority) has finally been approved. I am so happy that I will be reunited with my wife soon and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone in this group—your guidance and support have been incredibly helpful throughout the process.

I applied from India and took the services of a UK-based solicitor to assist with the process, which really helped in ensuring everything was submitted correctly and smoothly.

Sharing my timeline below in case it helps others:

Application submitted: 25th June 

Biometrics: 27th June

ECO email received: 3rd July

Paid enquiry raised: 23rd July

Approval email received: 25th July


So in total, it took 19 working days from Bio date.

I do think the paid enquiry helped speed things up, as I’ve seen others mention similar experiences here as well.

Wishing the best to everyone still waiting — your turn is coming soon! 🙌

1mbmqos,Spouse visa & white paper – still 5 years?,"Hi everyone,
I was granted a spouse visa in November 2024. At that time, my partner was a British ILR holder, not a citizen yet. I’ve read the new immigration white paper but couldn’t find a clear answer on whether spouse visa holders like me will still be eligible for ILR after 5 years.

If my partner becomes a British citizen before the new settlement rule is officially introduced, can I still apply for ILR after 5 years on the 5-year route, even though they were only an ILR holder when I first applied?

Will the new 10-year route affect people in my situation?

1ma15qu,Am I understanding section 3c correctly?,"Hi all,

Wife's first spouse visa is valid until August 22nd. Our plan is to apply for her extension (FLR M) on August 11th, once we've received her bank statement in the post showing her July pay.

1m8um9p,Help needed,"Hello everyone,
I’m planning to apply for a UK spouse visa from outside the UK in October and need help understanding how my pay dates will affect my application.
I currently have two jobs:
	•	One job pays every 4 weeks
	•	The other used to be bi-weekly but has recently changed to monthly (end of the month)
I spoke to my second employer and they said the pay period is from the 26th of each month to the 26th of the next, and payment is made the following week. So, for example:
	•	Pay period: 26 June – 26 July
	•	Payment received: around 1 August

Now I’m confused because some say that will count as July pay (based on the payslip) and others say it counts as August income (based on the bank deposit date) which matters a lot when calculating the 6-month income window for the visa. Would it be better for me to ask the employer to pay me on the ACTUAL last day of the month or leave it as it is and clearly explain payroll timing on the application? Any advice will be appreciated.

1m84l6v,Recent Approval Trends (July 2025),"I hope I am not stepping on any of the mods' feet here or anything - but this sub is so incredibly helpful for so many of us who are playing the waiting game, so I wanted to put this post together.  It is an overview of outside-UK application approval trends over the past few days.  Perhaps it will help or inform some of us who are still waiting (myself included!).

I calculated the working days from biometrics dates for all applications.  Weekends were not included.  Working day 1 assumed as day after biometrics.  Date of ECO email was disregarded as this is such an unreliable and intermittent indicator.  If any of my math is off please feel free to post a comment and correct me!

There are a lot more approval notices from earlier this week that I could have included but I don't have the time currently to go back that far.  But at least this will serve as a snapshot of the past couple of days' approvals.

I may update with additional new timelines from approvals posted later this week.)",2025-07-24T13:34:58,ObviousRanger9155,18,36,spousevisauk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpouseVisaUk/comments/1m84l6v/recent_approval_trends_july_2025/,"['evisa', 'spouse visa']","Recent Approval Trends (July 2025) I hope I am not stepping on any of the mods' feet here or anything - but this sub is so incredibly helpful for so many of us who are playing the waiting game, so I wanted to put this post together.  It is an overview of outside-UK application approval trends over the past few days.  Perhaps it will help or inform some of us who are still waiting (myself included!).

I calculated the working days from biometrics dates for all applications.  Weekends were not included.  Working day 1 assumed as day after biometrics.  Date of ECO email was disregarded as this is such an unreliable and intermittent indicator.  If any of my math is off please feel free to post a comment and correct me!

1) How difficult will it be for me to be approved for a rental with a share code that expires in November? 

We have the option to stay with my partners parents for a few months, but this is over a 2h journey to both our workplaces. Doable, but not ideal.

2) We can prove cohabitation from 11th of October (lease agreement), and have been together since May 2022. Will we need to provide proof of current address at the time of our application (i.e. if this is his parents and not a new lease)? 

3) We might be overseas from the 12th December. If we apply on the 11th October (2 years since we moved in together), are we likely to have the Visa approved before then? If not, should we consider applying earlier or avoid overseas travel? 

5) If we apply earlier, what is required to prove we have been in a committed relationship from May 2022?",2025-07-23T15:50:56,taigsc,1,1,spousevisauk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpouseVisaUk/comments/1m7cwl0/moving_from_youth_mobility_to_unmarried/,['share code'],"Moving from Youth Mobility to Unmarried Partnership Visa: our situation & questions Hello!

I wanted to thank everyone for their help. This subreddit has helped us a lot. I am putting down my detailed application timeline and everything we used.

We didn't use solicitors and we put our whole application together in 3 days.

>Application Timeline -

* 1st June 2025 - Application submitted.
* 9th June 2025 - Additional docs requested to prove ""Our genuine and subsisting relationship.""
* 25th June 2025 - Application was approved - but we didn't receive any confirmation mail nor my E-visa was updated. We only found out about it on 21st July.
* 21st July 2025 - Finally my E-visa was updated, but I still haven't received any decision email from UKVI, they are not sure why I didn't receive the email.

>Relationship Timeline -

* Started dating in Jan 2023. I was on student visa and my partner on a SWV.
* In our culture and religion, it is not allowed to live together unless we have introduced each other to our parents, which we did in Dec 2023.
* We moved in together in April 2024.
* We have been living together since.

>Resources we used -

Collating docs and clearly naming/labelling them for uploading helped us be organised. I am adding the Index doc that we uploaded for the caseworker to reference what docs have been uploaded.

Basically, my wife is filling out the spouse visa and is filling in my employment details to show I meet the financial requirements. I have been employed by the same company for 5 years so, regarding the “have they been employed by the same employer for the last 6 months” question, we’ve put “yes”.

However, it then says “what do they earn”? Well, we’re stuck, as it depends on what period they’re referring to. The answer is either “same amount above the requirement” or “different amount above the requirement”.

I was paid £41,000 up until November last year, when I was promoted and got a pay rise to £44,000.

So I have not earned £44,000 for a full year yet, hence saying that amount per annum is not accurate?

What should we do? It changes the amount of payslips I need to attach, stretching from 6 to 12, which will include end of year bonuses as well.

1m5pjj0,Inside UK standard app. approved,"Hi all

Posting this as it was great reassurance to see peoples timelines when I was waiting for our application decision.

Application from Inside the UK, standard, same-sex couple, civil partnership, sponsor is EU citizen settled in the UK

Dates:
Application submitted: 12 of June
Bio: 14 of June
Decision: 21st of July

Our application was fairly standard, as we were in a civil partnership, lived together (for 1.5y before applying), met the financial requirements through sponsors wage. 

Documents we provided:

To prove identity: Both passports (all pages scanned), both of our Evisa share codes and Evisa webpage

To prove our financials: sponsors employment letter, sponsors 6 month bank statements, sponsors 6 months payslips

To prove our address: 2 years lease, 3x joint address proof and 6x individual address proof that covers 2 years (unsure if this was necessary since as we are in a civil partnership there is no requirement of cohabitation for 2 years yet we provided our shared proof for 1.5y and individual proof for the 6 months prior when we didnt live together.)

To prove a genuine relationship: cover letter with brief relationship timeline, and document with photos from our 2 years together. We had around 3 photos for each 6 months, spread evenly. Included photos of us with my family, at her sisters wedding, for christmas celebrations, etc.

To prove her knowledge of English: transcript from her masters degree in the UK. 

Hope this helps anyone!

1m4ywy9,UK Unmarried Partner Visa - Unable to prove 2 years of living together,"Hello, I am writing this post to know the chance of my partner getting approved a UK family visa as an unmarried partner.

I am a French with a Settled Status / Indefinite Leave to Remain. She is Turkish with her Graduate visa expiring in November 2025.

We have been together since December 2022 when i was already working on a full time job and she was finishing her master.

After she finished her master in end of August 2023 (which coincided with the end of her rental contract with her flatmate), she moved all her belongings to my flat share (with one other flatmate).

From September 2023 to February 2025, she was in between Turkey, where she has been learning about her family business, and London where she was coming to visit and live with me for long periods. During that time, she was not on our tenancy agreement, and the only evidences of living together during that time are bank statements which were at the same address, and a testimony from our flatmate during that period.

After going to Turkey together in October 2024 and having met all with all her relatives, her family got comfortable about us living together and accepted that we could move formally in a flat together. just the two of us.

In February 2025, we managed to find a place to move in together and this time we have all solid proofs showing that we are well living together (tenancy agreement, utility bills, etc...)

We plan to apply for the unmarried partner visa, on the following basis : - we have been in a serious relationship for more than 2 years and 8 months - we have not been able to live together just the two of us before February 2025 because her family was not comfortable with the idea, and she was in between Turkey and London during that period - as soon as we got the approval from her family about us moving together the two of us and settle in London. We went looking for a flat and acted the move in February 2025 - We now have all the evidences that we live together in London and have a similar lifestyle than a married couple

Would you have a view on this application, and advice for it to be successfully approved ? If you believe that it will be rejected, could you please provide info on what's missing in our case ?

1m4t6tm,(Difficult) Spouse Visa Approved,"We applied for the spouse visa with me going ahead to the UK to secure a job, then applying for my husbands visa from US. I was very worried that it wouldn't get approved because my last US employer had financial difficulties and stopped paying me (I earned over that £29k amount but didn't get paid it -  not my fault), so I was unable to prove I have over £29k income for the last 6 months and also had no paystubs which are listed as mandatory. My new UK job is over that threshold but I had just started it a week earlier. I provided copies of correspondence with my former employer discussing them not paying me, a letter from them confirming the situation, and I included two years of bank statements and my paystubs for the previous year. I figured that if they took the last two years income and averaged it out then I'm over the £29k each year so maybe that would be accepted. I also included my husbands paystubs and bank statements because even though its supposed to just be based on my income, since he works remote they coud at least see that extra income. No savings.

I was expecting it to be rejected until I could prove 6 months in my new job at the required income, but it got approved. I'm so relieved and grateful. We have kids (all British citizens) and its so hard on them to have parents in separate countries.

Timeline: Applied on May 26th. Husband couldn't do the biometrics appointment until June 6th due to his schedule. June 9th I got an email saying we have to upload all documents asap. Visa approved July 4th. We did pay extra for 30 working day processing.

1m4r4vf,Spouse Visa Application: Last-Minute Doubts,"Hi everyone,

My wife and I are preparing her family visa application. I'm a British citizen, and she's Brazilian. We're in the final week before we intend to apply, and I just have a quick doubt I wanted to ask someone about.

The guidance page is quite clear that all documents which aren't in English or Welsh need to be translated. Fair enough. On my wife's current passport, most of the lines have an English translation underneath the original Portuguese, but there are one or two pages that are just in Portuguese.

The company VFS Global will scan her passport in the biometrics appointment, but do we need to get those one or two pages translated into English? The information in Portuguese which isn't translated is usually stuff like, ""Make sure you use pencil to add your address in the back of your passport.""

1m3vaxg,Spouse Visa Approved Inside UK – What Are the Travel Requirements Now That BRP Is Being Phased Out?,"Hi all,

I recently received my UK spouse visa approval this week (switched from Graduate Visa to Spouse Visa inside the UK). I’m planning to travel abroad in September 2025, and I’m a bit confused about what steps I need to complete before I can travel, especially since the BRP is no longer valid for travel after December 2024.

From what I understand, the Home Office is moving everything to digital immigration status — but I’m unsure what that means practically for re-entering the UK from abroad.

My questions are:
	1.	What documents do I need to carry for international travel (particularly re-entry to the UK)?
	2.	Do I need to apply for any physical document or digital proof before I travel?
	3.	Will my online “View and Prove your immigration status” page be enough at the border?
	4.	Has anyone else recently travelled after getting a spouse visa (under the new digital system)?

Any help or recent experience would be really appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

We had some minor issues that I addressed proactively in my cover letter, but they seemed to have accepted them without the need for additional documents.

1m1rbjg,Inside UK - Married Spouse Visa,"Hi everyone, 

I’m looking for some advice or guidance from anyone who’s been through something similar.

I’m currently on a Graduate visa (valid until May 2026). My partner has a settlement / ILR.

We’ve been together since May 2024 and plan to apply for the Spouse visa late this year/early next year, once we officially get married.

We were living in the same town but in different places i.e. shared houses, and we've signed a joint tenancy agreement and are moving in together on 9 August, and we’ve booked an appointment to give notice of marriage the day before, on 8 August, which was the earliest available slot.

We’re planning a civil marriage at the local register office - no big ceremony, just something simple. 

A few things I’m wondering:

- Has anyone else given notice before officially moving in together? I know that we currently meet the requirement of living in the same district for 8+ days but, is that ever seen as negative by the registrar or Home Office (as far as I am aware it will be referred to the HO due to my status)?

- We haven’t picked a specific wedding date yet, just the venue due to potential 70 days clearance process by the HO - is that a problem at the notice appointment?

- We’re both working full-time on fixed-term contracts, my contract end date is the same as my residency expiry date (my salary is over the requirement, but we thought combining both incomes just in case) - any risks there from the Home Office’s perspective?  

Would really appreciate any thoughts, similar experiences, or advice you might have given the situation in general. 

We’re trying to do everything by the book and stay ahead of things, just a bit nervous about the timing around the notice and the application process.

1m1k9gy,Looking for advise and if we needs an immigration solicitor for a uk spouse visa.,"Im looking for some assistance if the people on here could advise if they think we need a immigration solicitor. 

I am a brittish citizen from birth and my wife is Malawian living and working in south africa. I work for extended periods in South Africa regularly. We first met online on a dating site in August 2024 and when I went to South Africa for work in October 2024 we met in person, we started dating and things went very very well. When I returned home we stayed in contact every day until I returned in March 2025. On my second visit she moved into the AirBnB I was renting with me and  In April 2025 we got legally married in South Africa and I have a unabridged marriage certificate from the south african home affairs. 

We applied for 2 visitor visas whilst un married and both were refused, the first was down to travel history errors and financial issues due to not explaining her bank statements well enough we addressed the issues on the second attempt and it was refused due to her economic situation they did not believe she would return. I felt it a little unjust but it is what it is. 

We are going through the application now and she is completing her A1 language test and her TB screening in South Africa this month. Once we have these we believe we will have enough to apply. I earn well in excess of £29K and own a 4 bedroom house that only myself and my daughter live in. We have lots of photos together and thousands of call logs. I have a letter from my mother and a letter from her mother explaining they know of our relationship etc etc. I have done a relationship timeline and 2 separate letter one an invite and the other a detailed cover letter explaining everything.

1m0ju19,Evisa before first travel?,"Hi all,

My wife is flying tomorrow to join me in UK after our successful application.

She has her passport with the Vignette inside as normal, 

However we are receiving conflicting information about the need for a UKVI account and E-visa before travelling.

For example this is from AI taken from Google:

“Yes, if you have a spouse visa vignette (a sticker in your passport), you'll need to create a UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account and register your travel document (usually your passport) with your eVisa before your first trip to the UK”

Has anyone travelled very recently and can confirm the E-visa is 100% not needed until after arrival here or is the above statement now correct?

She’s travelling from Philippines so I’m just worried that now we are transitioning to electronic visas they may demand this at the airport regardless of the Vignette.

1lzz887,spouse visa UK,"Hi,  


My husband and I are currently preparing to apply for a **UK spouse visa**, and we would be so grateful for any advice from people who have recently been through this process — especially if you applied from Russia.



I’m a Russian citizen, born and raised in Turkmenistan, and I’m applying from Moscow. My husband and I met five years ago, officially started dating in June 2023, and got married in Georgia in April 2025. We also lived together for nine months in Uzbekistan before he returned to the UK to work and meet the financial requirement. He now earns above the threshold and will have completed six months of qualifying income by 1st August, so we’ll be ready to apply from then.



We’ve done a lot of research online, but some of the information is outdated, as policies and fees have changed. We have received advice, but we’d like to double-check it and ensure we don’t miss anything important.



*If you’ve applied recently, we’d appreciate it if you could provide information on the following:*

* What documents were definitely required?
* What’s the best way to show your relationship is genuine?
* Are there any documents it’s better not to include?



*Here’s a list of what we’ve been asked to provide so far:*

* Marriage certificate (notarised and translated from Georgian)
* A1 English language test certificate
* TB test certificate
* 40 photographs (not dated)
* Passports for both of us – only international ones, with just the stamped/used pages
* Letter from my husband’s employer confirming job title, start date, and salary
* My husband’s payslips from February to July (6 months)
* His bank statements for the same period – he’ll get them from the bank on 1st August, but we’re unsure if they need to be stamped and signed
* Land registry document for his parents’ UK property where we will reside (five-bedroom house)
* Letter from my husband’s parents (homeowners) confirming we can live there, with details of all current occupants and their consent
* Recent council tax bill for the parents' house
* Utility bills (water, gas, or electricity) from the last 3 months



*And here’s what we’ve been told* ***NOT*** *to include (but we’re unsure about some of these):*

* Dated photographs (I’d still like to create a small photo album with captions and dates)
* Screenshots of our messages or chats, even though they show regular contact
* My birth certificate (but we’re unsure if it should be included and/or translated)
* Scans of every page of my international passport – only one page is used, the rest are blank due to my recent name change
* I have a patronymic name which appears in Russian Cyrillic in my international passport. Should this be included as part of my given name on the UK spouse visa application?
* Should I provide my internal passport (ID card) and Turkmenistan passport – do these need to be translated?
* Photos of the house we’ll live in (my in-laws' home)
* A cover letter explaining our relationship



***Any advice or clarification from those who’ve gone through the process recently would be massively appreciated. We want to make sure we’re submitting a strong and complete application, and that the advice we received is accurate. Thanks in advance!***

* Dated photographs (I’d still like to create a small photo album with captions and dates)
* Screenshots of our messages or chats, even though they show regular contact
* My birth certificate (but we’re unsure if it should be included and/or translated)
* Scans of every page of my international passport – only one page is used, the rest are blank due to my recent name change
* I have a patronymic name which appears in Russian Cyrillic in my international passport. Should this be included as part of my given name on the UK spouse visa application?
* Should I provide my internal passport (ID card) and Turkmenistan passport – do these need to be translated?
* Photos of the house we’ll live in (my in-laws' home)
* A cover letter explaining our relationship

1lzigxi,Gifted Money for UK Fiancé/Spouse Visa (Savings Route) – Looking for Advice or Shared Experience,"Hello everyone,

I’m a Filipina, and my fiancé is British. We’ve been in a committed relationship for 3 years after meeting online, and we’ve made sure to see each other twice a year—whether in the UK, the Philippines, or during holidays abroad. I also visited the UK earlier this year on a tourist visa.

We’re planning to apply for the UK fiancé visa around June 2026, get married, and then switch to the spouse visa. Our main challenge is meeting the new £29K financial requirement. My fiancé earns about £20K/year, so we’re relying on a mix of his income and around £45K in savings by the end of this year.

The complication is that £20K of those savings was a gift from a family friend in May 2025. Since UKVI usually requires 6 months of bank statements, the gift may not appear by the time we apply.

We’d really appreciate any advice or insight on the following:

1. Has anyone here used gifted money for the savings route? Was it accepted?

2. What’s the best way to prove it’s a genuine gift, not a loan? (We can provide a signed letter from the person who gave it.)

3. We submitted my fiancé’s bank statements in Feb 2025 for my tourist visa—could UKVI compare those and question the sudden increase in savings?

We’re doing our best to prepare everything honestly and clearly, and would be so grateful for any advice or shared experiences.

1lydea7,Unmarried partner visa/ANY VISA UK advice and help needed!,"Hi everybody, 

I'm hoping someone here can offer advice, encouragement, or share their experience. I’m (planing) applying for the UK Unmarried Partner Visa. Unfortunately my fiancé and I don’t meet the financial requirement for the 5-year route, and I’m really nervous about it.

Here’s my situation:

I’m a 20-year-old German citizen, and my fiancé is British. We met through the internet and  we’ve been in a committed long-distance relationship since October 2019, and we first met in person in September 2021 (after COVID made meeting impossible).

We’ve been seeing each other regularly — every 2–3 months — for the past 3+ years.
We’ve never lived together due to financial limits and visa barriers and education,but we have a long, stable, loving relationship and we’re engaged now.
He earns about £22,000/year pre-tax, so we don’t meet the £29k requirement for the 5-year spouse visa.
I can’t really say I’m planning to apply under the 10-year route but we feel so lost because every immigration solicitor says something different. One says that I will have the 10 year route and argue that forcing us to live apart or relocate to Germany would breach our human rights (Article 8 ECHR). And one says because I’m an EU citizen there’s a visa for me to work for 6 months in the uk to have our income combined to meet the financial requirements.

Here's the emotional and personal context:
I cannot live in Germany safely anymore. I currently live in Germany tho.
My mother has schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (very severe) and struggles with addiction issues like compulsive shopping.
My father is the sole carer for my uncle, who has ALS. He can’t support me.
I have no emotional support network in Germany, only trauma. Being forced to stay there would severely damage my mental health.
My fiancé can’t move to Germany — he doesn’t speak the language and would lose his job, his family can’t relocate due to health issues.
We’ve done our best to hold the relationship together long-distance, but it’s draining and heartbreaking.
I’m a qualified early childhood educator (Erzieherin) and passed the B1 English test with Merit. I want to live, work, and build my life in the UK.
What I’m afraid of:
We were told that many 10-year route applications get refused, especially if there’s no cohabitation. That terrifies me.
We’re working hard to build a strong application with letters, evidence, and a human rights statement, but we’re not sure how the Home Office will see our case.

Questions:
Has anyone successfully applied under the 10-year Unmarried Partner route without living together?
How much evidence do we need to prove emotional/mental hardship?
Should we try to marry first and apply as a spouse instead — even if we still don’t meet the £29k?
Is there any way I could come to the UK to work legally for 6 months and then combine our incomes?
Any advice, support, or real-life stories would mean so much. This is overwhelming, and we just want a chance to finally live together.

Thank you in advance. 🙏

However, on the visa information, it states we have to prove we have lived together for the part 2 years minimum, how can we do that if we have to move apart for 6 months to even get the visa?? 

Is this irrelevant? Is the fact that we HAVE lived together for 2 years at some point enough?

1lx4q2l,Switching from a fiancé to spouse visa - help needed,"Hi All

Long time lurker, first time poster here! My husband and I are in the process of completing the visa application to switch from his fiancé visa to a spouse visa. 

We’ve lived together since May of this year (so two months) when he first entered the UK. We married earlier this month.

I’m sure it’s the form being ridiculous in a way only UKVI understand, but can I safely ignore this requirement? I can provide a council tax bill which he’s named on but that’s all we have.

1lw13b6,SPOUSE VISA APPROVED (PRIORITY) BRAZIL HUSBAND & BRITISH HUSBAND,"BRA 🇧🇷 & BRI 🇬🇧 SPOUSE VISA APPROVED (PRIORITY)

Hi guys, I am happy to be posting my key timelines here as I know this will help, encourage and calm others down who are waiting for a successful application. I applied for Spouse Visa outside the UK (From Brasilia - Brazil) using the priority service. We are a gay couple and I’m Brazilian and my husband British. We are both seafarers working on 🚢 around the globe. 🌎. As we both work at sea, we used our savings to meet the financial threshold (£88.500). 

•	Marriage: 25 April Gibraltar 

•	Solicitor: Yes (First Migration based in London) £1400 fee

•	Application submitted: 13th June 

•	Biometrics: 18th June

•	ECO email: 20th June 

•	Successful email: 9th July @ 10:07 am

•	VFS Global: Passport yet to be received from Brasilia VSF



Just waiting for the passport to be returned by courier! It worked out perfectly as I have a flexible ticket booked for mid-July and I had set the entry for 25th July 2025 on my application. 

BACKGROUND: I had previously lived in the UK (for over 12 years) and submitted in Dec 2016 an application for leave to remain (ILR) which was refused in Apr 2017 as I had spent over 180 days outside the UK during this time.

Long story short, after the refusal I left the country voluntarily and returned to Brazil and started working on ships around the globe. During my time at sea, I met my husband and got married earlier this year. We used a well known solicitor in London who helped us immensely to gather all the necessary docs to submit our application. It is an expensive process (£1400 solicitor fee alone) and since I have lived in UK before and had a visa application refused, I thought it would be best to seek professional advice prior to submit my application. Very pleased I did so as it puts your mind to rest. 

I hope those who are waiting get their successful decision soon. God bless.",2025-07-10T02:10:35,Professional-Pay9604,17,9,spousevisauk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpouseVisaUk/comments/1lw13b6/spouse_visa_approved_priority_brazil_husband/,"['spouse visa', 'ILR']","SPOUSE VISA APPROVED (PRIORITY) BRAZIL HUSBAND & BRITISH HUSBAND BRA 🇧🇷 & BRI 🇬🇧 SPOUSE VISA APPROVED (PRIORITY)

1lvd0q5,"🇲🇽🇵🇱 UK Spouse Visa Advice, Polish citizen in UK, partner is Mexican living in Lisbon – civil marriage in Poland?","Hi everyone,
I’m looking for some advice or experiences regarding the UK spouse visa process.

I’m a Polish citizen with settled status in the UK (living here since 2008) and currently earning £33,000, with potential to increase to £40,000 within the same company. My partner is Mexican, we met in London during her stay here, and I’ve recently visited her in Mexico. She’s now about to start a new job in Lisbon.

Our goal is to eventually settle in the UK together, ideally starting the process next year. From what I understand, as she’s a non-EU citizen, the most realistic path forward is through the UK spouse visa. We're planning to do a civil marriage in Poland, then apply for the visa.

Currently, I live with family in the UK, but I'm working towards securing a rented flat of our own. I read that you need to demonstrate you can afford rent or show intent to live together  is this true? Would living with family temporarily (as a backup) be considered acceptable if we clearly intend to find our own place?

Also:

Once she’s in the UK on the spouse visa, would I still need to maintain the £29k income level to extend it after 2.5 years?

Is it worth hiring a solicitor to guide us through the application? We’re prepared to be very thorough and start saving now.


Any advice from someone who went through a similar path would be hugely appreciated — especially if you were also from the EU with a non-EU partner.

Thanks in advance!

1lv9kvx,Right to rent share code,"Hi everyone,

My wife (UK citizen) and I are in UK now starting to do some planning.  We met with a letting agent and she mentions the Share Code for right to rent.  I’m reading this page and I’m assuming you need your visa FIRST before you will get a share code is that correct?

If so - does that mean we should 
1) have the lease done in ONLY my wife’s name and add me later 
2) apply for the VISA using my in-laws address and then ask for share code AFTER approval and then do the lease 
3) you can get a share code right after cresting a UKVI account (doesn’t seem like this is how it works)

My assumption is either option 1+2

1lv5scv,🇲🇦 Spouse Visa Approved – Priority – From Morocco 🇬🇧❤️,"Application submitted: 2 June 2025
Biometrics: 12 June 2025
Decision received: 8 July 2025
Country: Morocco
Service: Priority
ECO email: None received

✨ My Journey in Short:
I got married in 2021, but unfortunately I started my immigration process with the wrong legal support. A previous lawyer submitted an incorrect application (Pre-Settlement), and that mistake cost me 4 years, a lot of money, and I went through multiple refusals — even the Home Office and the Tribunal rejected my case. I truly felt lost.

Everything changed when I got proper advice. I returned to Morocco and submitted the correct Spouse Visa application with strong legal guidance. It was a very hard decision — I was scared I wouldn’t be allowed back — but I trusted the process.

And here I am —, my visa is approved!
I want to tell everyone who’s feeling hopeless: don’t give up. Even after years of loss and rejection, the right steps can open a new door for you. There is always a way forward with the correct support and faith.

To anyone going through this:
Stay strong, stay hopeful, and trust your journey.
Your time will come too. 🤍

1lv5gh2,Do I Meet the £29k Spouse Visa Requirement with 4month unemployment gap ? (Appendix FM – Category B),"Hi everyone,

My spouse and I got married in December 2024, and I took a few months off work afterwards. I recently started working again in May 2025 and now have two jobs earning roughly £4,000/month after tax (~£5,000/month gross).

Here’s a quick breakdown:
	•	📅 July–Dec 2024: Working, earning approx. £3,750/month gross
	•	📅 Jan–Apr 2025: Not working (personal time off after marriage)
	•	📅 May–Present (July 2025): Working 2 jobs, earning ~£5,000/month gross
	•	❗️I don’t have access to payslips from my old job (July–Dec 2024)

So far, my estimated gross income in the past 12 months is around £37,500. My current gross annual income is about £70,000.

We want to apply now (July), but I’m worried:
	1.	Can I still apply under Category B, even though I only started working again in May and don’t have payslips from my previous job?
	2.	Is it mandatory to submit all payslips from the past 12 months, or is current income + a partial work history enough?
	3.	We really don’t want to wait another 3 months just to qualify under Category A. Is it realistic to apply now?

Thanks so much in advance!

1lum547,Married spouse visa super priority - inside UK: successful application July 2025,"Other key important details:

* Marriage ceremony was within the UK
* Financial requirement: category D cash savings only
* NO solicitor
* Switch from student visa

Hiya! First and foremost I have to thank this amazing community and top contributors. You guys are amazing 🫶🏽, whenever I had doubts or questions (however stupid they are), I've always got my answers and assurance here so I would like to give back to the community by sharing the details of my application and timeline.

**Timeline**

End of May: English test at LanguageCert. Got official result within 3 days (email) and a week (letter).

Mid June-1 July: Collect all supporting documents, especially bank statements.

2 July: Application submitted to UKVI and, after paying IHS surcharge and visa fee, immediately got a slot for biometrics appointment in Bristol TLScontact (I submitted at 11am on a Wednesday) for 8 July. I opted in for uploading supporting documents myself, which needs to be completed before appointment.

7 July: Submitted all supporting documents through TLS website (details below).

8 July:

* Appointment at 9AM, finished by 9.20AM. They only need to see my valid passport. I went overboard by printing everything I had uploaded which was NOT needed at all.
* 10AM received TLS confirmation email that biometric collection is confirmed.
* 11.43AM received an email from Home Office that application is successful!

**Supporting documents**

1. Application housekeeping: a) Document checklist provided by UKVI at the end of application - filled with checkmarks, b) application form, c) appointment confirmation.
2. Cover letter: Only signed by myself. I wrote this mainly to help whoever assessed my application going through the documents in a much more systematic way. This might be (part of) the reason why the decision came really fast. Example paragraph is below and at the end of the letter I listed all the supporting documents, and when uploading, I named it as it was written on the cover letter.

*I am writing to submit my application for a Family Visa as a spouse to my husband, \[his name\]. I am currently enrolled as a student at the \[university name\] and am residing in the UK on a Student Visa (Appendix 1). My husband is a British citizen (Appendix 3) and we met at the university in September 20XX. Our relationship began in October 20XX, and we moved in together in student accommodation in August 20XX (Appendix 4 and 5). He proposed to me in August 20XX and we were married on \[date of marriage\] (Appendix 6). \[...\]*

*End of letter:*  
*Appendix 1. \[my name\] valid passport and old BRP.*  
*Appendix 2. Declaration and consent pages signed by \[my name and my husband's name\]*  
*Appendix 3. \[my husband name\] valid passport.*  
*Appendix 4. Council tax 20XX-20XX in \[city name\].*  
*Appendix 5. Tenancy agreement 20XX-20XX in \[city name\].*  
*Appendix 6. Marriage certificate*  
*\[...\]*

3. Declaration and consent pages from UKVI, **ink-signed and scanned**.  
4. Proof of accommodation in the past 2 years: a) council tax, b) tenancy agreement, and c) letter from landlord. I understand this was less of a concern since we are married so I was not too thorough.  
5. Proof of current accommodation: a) council tax, b) bank statement, c) electricity and gas bill, d) home insurance policy; all of which had both our names.  
6. Proof of intention to live together: As we are very fortunate to jointly own a place, and this just came through recently, we provided a) dated and signed TR1 forms and b) completion statement from our conveyencer to prove that we own the property.  
7. Marriage certificate.  
8. Bank statements for all cash savings and declaration of sources of the cash savings. Declarations were all ink-signed and scanned. We used 3 cash savings: 2 were under my husband's name, 1 was jointly owned. One of the cash savings was an ISA.  
9. English test result.  
10. Other proof of relationship: 10 photographs of me and my husband, with friends and family, throughout the relationship.

Hope this information helps everyone who's planning to apply or in the process of applying and I am happy to give further details and answer any questions (if I know the answer)!

1luivfc,Starting the process of applying for spouse visa (unmarried),"Hi lovely community,

have been a passive reader for a while but will soon begin the application for the spouse visa. I have searched the forum, looked at checklists provided and looked at the official guidance from gov.uk. Out of an abundance of caution and to ease my mind, I wanted to ask if I have understood everything correctly. 

First of all, some background information:

* I (applicant) am a Swedish national currently living in Germany
* My partner (sponsor) is a UK national. She is self-employed, meets the financial requirement, and is a homeowner.
* We have been together for almost 3 years, but have not lived together since our visas don't allow us to live together (brexit)

Here are the documents we plan to provide:

* Passport copy applicant
* Passport copy sponsor
* Relationship evidence
   * Personal statements from both partners
   * Screenshots of messaging from throughout the years
   * Call logs 
   * Photos from througout the years, from trips and with family
   * Travel history (airplane and hotel bookings)
   * Letters from family members (sponsor's older brother, applicant's mother)
* Justification of not living together (written explanation)

have been a passive reader for a while but will soon begin the application for the spouse visa. I have searched the forum, looked at checklists provided and looked at the official guidance from gov.uk. Out of an abundance of caution and to ease my mind, I wanted to ask if I have understood everything correctly. 

First of all, some background information:

* I (applicant) am a Swedish national currently living in Germany
* My partner (sponsor) is a UK national. She is self-employed, meets the financial requirement, and is a homeowner.
* We have been together for almost 3 years, but have not lived together since our visas don't allow us to live together (brexit)

Here are the documents we plan to provide:

* Passport copy applicant
* Passport copy sponsor
* Relationship evidence
   * Personal statements from both partners
   * Screenshots of messaging from throughout the years
   * Call logs 
   * Photos from througout the years, from trips and with family
   * Travel history (airplane and hotel bookings)
   * Letters from family members (sponsor's older brother, applicant's mother)
* Justification of not living together (written explanation)
* Financial proof (provided by sponsor)
   * 12 months bank statmeents (self employed partner)
   * SA302 tax return

1lu3g7o,Spouse Visa Partner's Self Employment Evidence,"Hi,
I am the applicant(M) applying from UK. My wife is currently self employed and also in non- salaried employment. I have some questions, it would be great if you guys can answer.

1- She is a partner with her Father in Self Employment. The business account is in her Father's name since it is a Newspaper distribution business with majority of customers from older generations and they usually write checques or pay in cash. So it is difficult to change the bank account for that matter. We are planning to write this in her personal statement and the accountant's letter. She did receive around 10 K from her father in her personal bank account in relevant tax year. Rest of the income is in form of cash and would be confirmed through her self- tax assesment and a letter from accountant confirming so. I want to know if this arrangement could work.

2- We are going to combine her Self Employment income with Non- Salaried employment income. Should we do it under Category F or if anyother category would be suitable.

3- Based on above information what evidence documents we need for her self employment.

I would be grateful, if you can answer these questions.

This was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life—but we made it. You'll all make it and survive. Just play it smart and safe. If you have any questions along the way, use this sub or the Facebook group (UK Spouse Visa). However, I also I highly recommend using* [*https://www.perplexity.ai/*](https://www.perplexity.ai/) *for quick, helpful answers.*

**Timeline (Priority - USA):**

* **App submitted:** May 23
* **Biometrics:** May 27
* **Approval received:** July 4 @ 3:07pm (28 working days / 6 weeks)
* **Passport Arrived via Courier:** July 8

**Why Unmarried Partner Route?**  
We’ve been together for 6 years but chose to get married in the UK and switch to the Spouse visa upon renewal.

**What Went Wrong / Lessons Learned:**

* *Booked travel before approval* — added a **ton** of stress.
* *Solicitor delayed us* — we were ready to apply in early May, but our solicitor was super slow. Don’t rely on them to act fast.
* *Priority ≠ fast* — I thought it’d be approved in \~20 WD like many others, but ours took **28 WD**.

**Case Complexity:**

* We used **savings + employment** for financial requirements.
* Discovered last minute that my partner’s savings account still had his **mother’s name** on it. We had to delay by a month to remove her name + wait for the new statement without her name on it.

**Evidence for Unmarried Partner Route:**

* 6 years together
* Joint leases
* Photos (with dates)
* Travel receipts
* Mail with both names
* Wedding invites

**Advice:**

* Don't obsessively check VFS tracker or forums. It'll do nothing but exacerbate your anxiety.
* Use a solicitor if your case isn’t straightforward—but **vet them properly**. Ours was cheap, but the communication sucked and delayed us.
* If you *must* book travel early, give yourself **6–7 weeks minimum**, even with Priority.

1ltdhnb,"About to have a baby, finish uni, and switch visas","And I’m so overwhelmed.

A year ago, I landed in the UK as a student, newly married and full of hope. Fast forward to now — I’ve submitted my master’s thesis, I’m 38 weeks pregnant, and our first baby is due any day now.

My husband is on a Skilled Worker visa, and I’m on a Student visa that expires in September 2025. We got married and registered here in the UK, and we’re hoping to build a stable life here — at least until our child is 5–7 years old. My husband’s work is solid and he’s on track for ILR in a few years, and I hope to eventually apply with him.

But right now, with the baby almost here, I’m torn about what to do next. The thought of dealing with visa choices in just a few weeks (while taking care of a newborn!) is honestly so overwhelming. I have so much confusion on choosing either PSW(graduate route) or go for a dependent visa(family visa). I want to do what’s best for our future here — for my career, for our family’s settlement, and for our child’s stability.

A year ago, I landed in the UK as a student, newly married and full of hope. Fast forward to now — I’ve submitted my master’s thesis, I’m 38 weeks pregnant, and our first baby is due any day now.

My husband is on a Skilled Worker visa, and I’m on a Student visa that expires in September 2025. We got married and registered here in the UK, and we’re hoping to build a stable life here — at least until our child is 5–7 years old. My husband’s work is solid and he’s on track for ILR in a few years, and I hope to eventually apply with him.

But right now, with the baby almost here, I’m torn about what to do next. The thought of dealing with visa choices in just a few weeks (while taking care of a newborn!) is honestly so overwhelming. I have so much confusion on choosing either PSW(graduate route) or go for a dependent visa(family visa). I want to do what’s best for our future here — for my career, for our family’s settlement, and for our child’s stability.

1lsnxdd,Switch from graduate to spouse visa - is there enough time?,"Hello :) 

I met and began dating my partner in March this year. He came to the UK in 2023 to study a Masters. Following this, he has been on a graduate visa since May 2024, due to expire in May 2026. 

We’re from a religious background so living together isn’t an option for us, but we are prepared to marry soon if he is not able to find visa sponsorship through employment.

We were thinking of marrying in January 2026 and applying for the visa after that. My questions are:

- Will the fact that we are marrying after 10 months fail to prove that the relationship is genuine? What evidence is needed to support this? 

- We were also thinking of eloping and just having our parents at the ceremony, with a view to having a wider celebration following the visa application. Again, would this cause UKVI to view the wedding as a sham? 

Just to be clear, this is an 100% genuine relationship and not someone trying to pull the wool over my eyes! We’ve met friends and family and are continuing to do so at this stage, as well as enjoying being together!

	•	A wet signature on the sponsor declaration
	•	Additional chat screenshots and photos from 2024 and 2025
	•	I gathered and submitted everything requested by the morning of Friday, 27th June
	•	As of now (), I’ve had no response at all, and it’s been five  working days and obviously the weekend now .

Would chasing them now harm the application in any way?

1lriu1c,[SUCCESS] U.S. to UK Spouse Visa (Priority) – My Full Timeline + Tips,"📅 **TIMELINE**:

* **18 May 2025** – Submitted the online application and opted for priority service when booking biometrics.
* **24 May 2025** – Biometrics appointment. They refused to sign the document checklist (didn't affect my application), but they DID sign and stamp the biometrics appointment confirmation.
* **24 May 2025** – Mailed my passport + documents to VFS. I included:
   * Printed application
   * Passport
   * Document checklist (signed only by me)
   * Biometrics appointment confirmation page
   * UPS Shipping label
* **27 May 2025** – Documents received in New York. Got email confirmations from both VFS and UPS.
* **19 June 2025** – ECO (Entry Clearance Officer) email. It was generic, kind of vague. But if you uploaded your documents online, it just means wait it out.
* **23 June 2025** – Got the success email – I'd been granted entry clearance!
* **24 June 2025** – Received my passport + vignette via UPS.
* **29 June 2025** – Vignette start date (same date I listed as my intended UK arrival). Not sure if this helped my case go faster, but worth mentioning.

**📌 PROCESSING TIME**:

* So from biometrics on **24th May** and receiving my passport on **24th June**—that’s **23 business days** total, not including weekends. Honestly smoother than I expected!

**🌍 BACKGROUND**:

* As a U.S. citizen, I had to return home to apply for the UK spouse visa, since you must apply from a country where you have legal residency.
* We got married in the U.S. a year prior—it was faster, cheaper, and easier than doing it in the UK. Plus, the marriage certificate became the ""holy grail"" of our relationship evidence.

💡 **KEY TIPS + THINGS I LEARNED**:

* **Payment issues?** Our cards kept getting declined when paying the IHS and visa fee. **PayPal** worked instantly.
* **Courier submission return** just means VFS sends you two UPS shipping labels via email. One goes on your envelope, one goes in with your paperwork. We misunderstood this at first.
* Sign up for the **UPS notification service**—super helpful in tracking our packages along the way.
* If you want **priority**, do not click on the Bronze Package when choosing services. Skip all extras and continue to booking biometrics on the VFS website and select **USCIS**. That’s where you’ll see the actual speed options.

📂 **SELF-UPLOADED DOCUMENTS I INCLUDED (AND HOW I ORGANIZED THEM)**:

I might’ve gone a little overboard, but I didn’t get asked for anything else, so I guess it worked out! I grouped docs by category into clearly named PDFs (ex. “MarriageCertificate.pdf”). Here's what I included and the sections I put them under:

📝 **Proof of Application**

* Ticked and signed document checklist
* Confirmation of my biometrics appointment
* Photos of every single page of my passport—yes, even the blank ones
* PDF of my visa application (not sure if it was needed but I added it anyway)

💼 **Sponsor’s Employment**

* My husband’s cover letter—explaining our relationship and how long we’ve been together
* His employment and salary history
* His P60
* A copy of his passport (ID page only)
* A letter from his employer confirming his job and salary
* His work contract showing responsibilities

🏠 **Accommodation**

* A house survey he had done a while ago
* House deed
* Survey checklist confirming the place is liveable
* Mortgage letter
* Mortgage valuation report
* His own letter saying I can live with him now and always

🎓 **Education**

* My bachelor’s degree and university transcript
* His bachelor’s degree

**💰 Financial Evidence**

* Screenshots of my husband’s bank statements compiled into a PDF
* His wage slips—same idea, all in one PDF

**❤️ Relationship & Life Events**

* Facebook posts from our families showing us together
* Our marriage certificate
* Random, everyday messages between visits—nothing sappy, just regular convos
* My birth certificate
* PDFs of all my flight confirmations and boarding passes to the UK, plus short summaries of each visit
* 11 relationship photos from over the years (roughly 2 per year) with dates and short descriptions
* My husband’s birth certificate
* Husband’s boarding passes (formatted the same way as mine)

📌 **Other**

* My personal cover letter—explaining what I uploaded and a bit about our relationship
* My California state ID
* My husband’s UK driving licence

**💭 FINAL THOUGHTS**:

Don’t panic if something doesn’t go perfectly (like that unsigned checklist)—the process allows a little wiggle room. Just stay organized, stay calm, and screenshot everything.

Special thanks to this subreddit I was quietly stalking this place daily for tips, reassurance, and success stories. Honestly, it got me through some of the most anxiety-filled moments of the process. Every post, comment, and spreadsheet shared here gave me a little more confidence — so this is my way of giving back.

If you’re reading this while frantically Googling or refreshing your email… I see you. You’ve got this. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or need help with anything—happy to share more if I can!

1lqohxx,Using temporary contract payslips for visa?,"Hey,

My partner and I are planning to start the spouse visa. She is starting a 6 month contract job which pays over £29k, with an option to switch to a different role at her company afterwards, which she doesn't want to do if it can be helped.

My question is, can we use the 6 month of payslips from her temporary job, even if she is technically 'unemployed' once we apply for the visa? 

Should she stay at the company, or is she free to look for a different job? Once the temporary contract is over, we'll only have 4 months until her visa is over, so we are unsure of how to proceed.

1lqnkdx,Applicants with Early June Bio?,"Hello all!

Just wondering if anyone who applied for a fiance visa in early June got their decision yet? I'm currently 18WD from my ECO and 20WD from my Bio and slowly losing my mind....

My timeline is below for reference:

Priority from Malaysia

Application: 1st June

Bio 6th June

ECO 10th June

I think its made worse by the fact I've seen a few people who have done their Bio after me have already gotten their decision....not sure if its because most of the people here are applying for spouse visas, not fiance?

I thought my application was relatively straightforward (meet financial requirement, adequate accommodation, intent to marry) and haven't received any requests for additional documents. And probably the worst part is I won't know whether or not I have it approved until I collect my passport!

Will the fact that my job is a fixed-term contract be an issue?

Should I mention that I will be self-employed after it? (I have guaranteed earnings for the first year that are much higher than my fixed-term job, I was considering mentioning this in a cover letter but am unsure if it's wise)

1lp8iwh,Inside UK Spouse visa approved,"Hi All,
First of all Thank you everyone keeping me and my hope alive. My case wasnt straight forward. Want to share some of the story,sorry if this post is gonna be long:

Came to UK as a dependent of SWV but after few years we got divorced. HO curtailed my leave and I was ready to leave the UK but due to some political reasons I have to file asylum. I applied for asylum before my L2R was expired.

Then, I found my current partner who is a British citizen and we were in genuine relationship. We moved in together 2024 and started living together.
We then formed CP in 2025. Luckily, my notice period wasn’t extended to 70days. I received a letter from HO telling that they arent doing a investigation.
After that, I did my English test and applied for FLR M. I contacted alot of solicitors but no one were ready to take my case but I went through this reddit and did all by myself.I withdrew my asylum application after applying for FLR M.
My timeline are as follows:

Visa Application: 22 May 2025
Biometric: 29 May 2025

Additional Documents Email:27 June

1loyj53,Unmarried partner visa- 4 year relationship but only recently cohabited?,"Hi all- I’m looking to switch from a Skilled Worker visa to an unmarried partner visa with my fiancé. We’ve been together for four years in total, two of those years were effectively long distance until I moved to the UK for my masters degree in September 2022, and then started my job which currently sponsors me in September 2023. We have been continuously together but opted not to live together for a number of reasons:

1). Shortly after I arrived in the UK, he moved abroad for a work secondment for 6 months 

2). I was on a student visa for the first year I was here and did not have a guaranteed right to stay in the UK until I passed the probation for my current job in December of 2023. Even thereafter, having not worked for a full two years at my current role leaves me vulnerable to immediate redundancies and lay-offs with no recourse- I would not have wanted him to be in a position where he is liable to pay full rent for the two of us if I am suddenly unable to live/work in the UK (which happened to a former colleague of mine recently)

3). We both thought it was better for my ability to live here long term for us to live separately while I got accustomed to living in London and making sure I had my own social life and friends. 

We’re engaged, we’ve moved in together as of May 2025, we both earn well above the financial requirement, we have plenty of evidence of our relationship being genuine etc. I’m just worried about this two year cohabitation rule? Will it help that we now live together? I appreciate it is a risk no matter what but would be grateful if someone could weigh in on the legitimacy of the reasons I’ve enumerated above.

I just received the decision that my UK spouse visa is approved (finally, yay 🥹), and I’m now trying to access my eVisa.

I’m a bit confused though. Do I need to create a new UKVI account first, or should I be able to sign in using the same Gmail I used when I submitted my visa application?

1lo7ebh,British by descent child born outside the UK,"Hi, I have a question. We have a son who was born outside the UK, but he is British by descent. Do I need to wait for his British passport to apply for a spouse visa?

If not, how do I include him in the online application without him being counted as a dependent?

Let me explain: when the application asks if we have children, it then asks for their nationality. If I select “British,” it asks for a passport number. It also treats the child as a financial dependent — for example, on the sponsor’s side, it asks how much money is given to support the child.

How should I answer these questions correctly to show that we have a British child, but he is not a dependent for the purposes of the application?

I am 28yo Female, non-EU/UK resident on a health and care worker subcategory of tier2 visa. My boyfriend is scottish and an accountant we have been together for almost 3yrs now. On date 1 we talked about life, expectations and plans for future and been so open. We left feeling we are perfect for each other. I love him to bits. Theres no words to express it. And I am 1000% sure he feels the same cuz he makes me feel it. He has been crying his heart out since I lost my job due to redundancy and received my 60day curtailment letter. We are both shattered and struggling to figure out what to do. 

We have spoken in lengths about getting married to each other and his whole family loves us together and keep referring to me as their daughter in law already and make me feel like I’m a part of their family. Absolutely adore them. Same goes for my parents. They cannot speak fluent english but can hold a conversation and absolutely adore him and how he treats me. His mum has told me before I even got a letter that he has some surprise for me and I had seen a ring in the wardrobe before I even lost my job. We always had a plan to get married by next year this time anyway. 

His family and him have been discussing with me to give the unmarried partner visa, spouse visa, fiance visa a thought and asking me to stop looking for and forget getting a sponsored job again because we might have to do this ‘couples visa’ in a years time or so anyway. We have elaborate plans on how we want to get married so we thought we will take our time to build our finances and plan the wedding and for the fiance visa I need to leave the country first which and can’t work when on it so it might impact my future potential jobs due to gaps, so we wanted to see if we can apply for unmarried partner visa. 

WE ARE NOT TRYING TO CHEAT OR WORK THE SYSTEM, we’re genuinely in love with each other and cannot imagine our lives without one another so please don’t look at us that way.  We meet all requirements of finances, relationship time, etc but ….

OUR ISSUE IS:

- We haven’t lived together for 2yrs since I had my own rented space and my parents weren’t comfortable about me live-in situation but they came around after knowing him. 
- He bought a house and was doing it up so lived with his mum at the time.

1lnyhtq,Applying for spouse visa. Trying to equipped myself with the knowledge required to properly navigate this step we’re taking.,"Hey guys, my wife, a British born citizen and I, a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago recently got married in my home country.

Now we are ready to apply for a spouse visa so that we can properly start our lives together.
Some bits of information before we proceed. We are both blind.
She has been employed at a well-known financial establishment for the past 10 years and meets the financial requirement. Additionally, she is a recipient of PIP.
At the moment, I am unemployed, since there is serious discrimination against job security for blind persons in Trinidad and Tobago.
My source of income comes from disability payments from my government. she is able to provide bank statements and pay Slips and can provide a job letter demonstrating her employment, history and current financial standing.
She is the owner of a bungalow that is suitable for both of us to live comfortably and healthily.
She has visited me twice at my home country twice. Once, for the first time we met in person and the second time, to spend my birthday with me.
I visited her twice in the UK. The first visit, after her first trip to Trinidad and Tobago and my second visit, after her trip to spend my birthday with me. 

We met on a Facebook messenger group for blind musicians in 2020. We were unable to meet each other in person before 2022, since there were strict rules governing my ability to leave the country and her ability to enter my country. At the time entry to my country was completely off the table unless extreme circumstances. 
From November 2020 to the present day, our relationship has been via WhatsApp calls and text, messenger calls and text and FaceTime.
 Her first trip to see me was November 2022. My first trip to see her was June 2023.
Her next trip to see me was February 20 24 and my next trip to see her was September 2024.
 In April 2025, she came to Trinidad and Tobago where we got married.
I have all the calls and messages for the five years of our communication on WhatsApp. We have E tickets for all of the flights her and I took too see each other and the trip that her and some of her family members took to Trinidad and Tobago for the wedding.
We have photos from each of the trips, showing us together and spending time with her and my family.
We have loads of wedding photos and an engagement photo.
Both our passports are valid. We have no criminal history or immigration violations.
As far as immigration goes, I recently applied for a visitors, visa to spend some time with her, but was rejected. Not understanding the form correctly, I feel to prove where the source of the money in my bank account came from.
I mentioned that I was going to see my wife, but did not provide excerpts from the WhatsApp chat. Neither did I have a marriage certificate at the time. I now have documentation proving my source of funds, our marriage certificate, and proof of our communication and travel history to see each other. We have scanned pages of our passports, where we took the flights mentioned to see each other. What more do we need? The work to prepare and getting everything ready is not an issue for me. I just want to know that we’re doing this properly. We’ve even elected to go for an immigration solicitor. Whilst yes, the solicitor is being paid to assist us with everything, I want to approach this venture with the necessary knowledge required to do this properly so that I can be fully informed, understand what’s happening and be able to contribute in a useful manner to this endeavor

1lnw9ou,Received Spouse Visa approval - VFS hasn’t acknowledged approval.,"Hi all,

Received an approval email from UKVI on 23 June. VFS status still says “awaiting decision from UKVI” as of 29 June. I noticed that I created an account and applied with one email, but the approval decision from UKVI came to a secondary email address I provided. Regardless, it’s the same application number, so just wondering how long it took VFS to acknowledge your approval and get your passport sent back to you? I’d really like to travel out of the country next week but can’t because they still have my passport.


Update: I received 6 emails this morning from UKVI to attend my biometrics appointment. I did so on 8 May and sent my passports to the VFS processing center. WHAT DO I DO?

Thanks!

Edit/ I’ve contacted UKVI to submit an official enquiry to VFS for the status of my documents since it’s been more than 10 working days. The number is +44 300 790 6268 and costs £0.60 per minute.

Hi all,

Received an approval email from UKVI on 23 June. VFS status still says “awaiting decision from UKVI” as of 29 June. I noticed that I created an account and applied with one email, but the approval decision from UKVI came to a secondary email address I provided. Regardless, it’s the same application number, so just wondering how long it took VFS to acknowledge your approval and get your passport sent back to you? I’d really like to travel out of the country next week but can’t because they still have my passport.


Update: I received 6 emails this morning from UKVI to attend my biometrics appointment. I did so on 8 May and sent my passports to the VFS processing center. WHAT DO I DO?

Thanks!

1lna16l,ILR Application might get unsuccessful — Spouse Visa might need?,"Hi all,

I'm really in need of some advice as I'm feeling desperate and unsure about what to do next. I'm having second thoughts and feeling very stuck.

My father, myself (I was 16 at the time), my brother (11), and my sister (2) came to the UK in 2016 after my mother applied for dependent visas for us. My mother has been in UK for 10 consecutive years now which she has currently in a ILR settlement visa.

Fast forward to now — my father and brother both had their ILR applications refused. However, my dad was offered a refund if he applies to extend his family visa within 10 working days. My brother was advised to pay the IHS fee to switch to the private life route, and he still has valid leave to remain until 3rd November.

My sister, now 12, hasn’t received a decision yet.

As for me, I’m 25 years old and I just got married 2 months ago to a British citizen. I applied for ILR under the child dependent route (SET(F)) on 29 October 2024, before my visa expired on 30 November 2024. I’ve been asked several questions during the process — including about when my fiancé (now husband) and I were getting married, etc. But I still haven’t received a decision.

I spoke with an immigration advisor who suggested I apply for a spouse visa now, before I get  an official refusal — which I think might be coming. But I’m also worried because the ILR application was expensive and I don’t think the Home Office will refund me if I withdraw or apply for a different visa now.

So I’m torn:

Should I wait for the decision (even if it's likely to be unsuccessful) and see if the Home Office offers any refund or guidance, like they did with my dad? Or should I apply for a spouse visa now, even if I lose the money I already paid for the ILR application? This whole situation is really draining me — it's constantly on my mind, and I feel completely stuck.

Also, my father and brother still have the right to work until they apply for what the Home Office has advised them to do. But I want to ask — would I lose my right to work if I receive an unsuccessful decision letter? I can’t lose my job as direct debits are continuous and the cost of living especially in UK is high and I can’t lose my job.

I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions.",2025-06-29T08:52:21,Particular_Doubl3x44,0,5,spousevisauk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpouseVisaUk/comments/1lna16l/ilr_application_might_get_unsuccessful_spouse/,"['spouse visa', 'ILR']","ILR Application might get unsuccessful — Spouse Visa might need?

1llcalg,Spouse visa extension - sponsor’s job,"A bit urgent as I am considering a job offer

Hello all. We have to apply for my husband's visa extension in March. Can you please help me with 2 questions regarding the income requirements:

1. What is the minimum I should earn as the sponsor? My husband applied for the first time in 2023. In the gov website, it says that we can use our combined income, is this true and what percentage of this combined income each has to contribute (if there are any % at all). 

2. If I work for a company in another country remotely, would this be ok for my application? Also, in this case, could my salary be considered as part of the income requirement or will be rejected on the grounds that it does not come from a UK-based emoloyer?

1lkoxti,[APPROVED] Spouse VISA | Standard | Bangladesh 🎉 🎊 🥳,"First things first, I genuinely believe that this could not have been done without help of all of the contributors in this community, so I want to give a **HUGEEE THANK YOU** to those who answered questions, those who shared their journeys and even those who are simply asking the questions. Every interaction has been beneficial.

When we started this journey, we had no idea where to go, who to ask or even what to do. All we knew was that there was a process - A process we was not familiar with.

We initially started trawling through Appendix FM and the Immigration Rules and honestly... It did more harm than good. It confused us, it made us start to worry, at this point, we were considering getting a solicitor. After googling a few solicitors and researching the task at hand, I miraculously ended up in r/SpouseVisaUk.

After a few days of reading hundreds and hundreds of posts, our confidence grew, we began understanding what we failed to understand before. This community helped us become proficient at understanding what was required of us and how to present our evidence.

We decided not get a solicitor in the end because we began to have so much faith in ourselves, it didn't feel right to hand over this responsibility to anyone else. We thought that if anyone was going to take great care and evaluate every little detail in the application, it would be us, the Applicant and the Spouse.

And so we jumped straight in, into the deep end, with ourselves and just this amazing community to look towards for help 😅

Here is our timeline:

APPLICATION DATE - 14th May 2025  
BIOMETRICS DATE VIA VFSGLOBAL SYLHET - 18th May 2025  
ECO EMAIL - 23rd May 2025  
<We did not receive any Automatic Updates>  
APPROVAL EMAIL - 25th June 2025 @ 16:07 BST  
PASSPORT READY FOR COLLECTION - 1st July 2025  
PASSPORT COLLECTED - 2nd July 2025  
(Vignette Inside with 3 Months Validity for Entry Clearance)

We received a decision in line with what is expected to be 75% of applicants as shown in u/Ravendorr's post on Percentile Data of Application Decisions.

22 Working Days from ECO | 27 Working Days from BIO

33 Total Days from ECO | 38 Total Days from BIO

We provided the following evidence:

**CORE DOCUMENTATION**

APPLICANTS' PASSPORT - We started panicking as we only uploaded the Bio and Data pages and nothing else. We had seen people had stated they uploaded Blank Pages of their passport after we had already submitted ours. At this point, we just thought if they need it, they may ask for it. There isn't anything of importance in blank pages but this had us panicking for 2 or 3 days before we just came to terms with it. We actually forgot about this blunder again when the ECO email came asking that if there was anything else we should provide, we would have 5 days to do it in. This didn't even cross my mind when ECO came. Now that we received approval, I think of my initial thought of ""why do they need blank pages uploaded"". Maybe they don't, who knows...

SPOUSE'S PASSPORT - This was straightforward, British Passport Bio Page and Data Page

APPROVED ENGLISH SPEAKING TEST RESULTS - We provided an IELTS A1 Life Skills Test Result Form which had the UKVI Number on it.

PRE-DEPARTURE TB MEDICAL EXAMINATION CERTIFICATE - Another straightforward piece of paperwork, all applicant did was attend an IOM facility for medical screening in Sylhet and then picked up the results a few days later.

**FINANCIAL**

12 MONTHS PAYSLIPS - We applied under Category A however Spouse had fluctuating Gross Pay amounts due to overtime and bonus payments. We incorrectly selected ""Not the same amount continuously, above the financial requirement amount"". After submission, we realised that maybe we could have selected ""The same amount continuously, above the financial requirement amount"" option. In reality, Spouse did have the same (fixed) salary amount each month (if you don't include the overtime and bonus) but when we was applying, we chose the most appropriate answer, or what we both thought to have been the 'correct' answer. When selecting this option, I think the application assumes Cat B, therefore we were requested to provide 12 months payslips which we did not mind providing. We made it extremely clear in our cover letter exactly which category we were intending to apply under as to not cause any confusion on the Decision Makers' end.

12 MONTHS BANK STATEMENTS - We provided 12 months Bank Statements, with Digital 'True Copy' Certifications on every page from Spouse's bank. We aren't sure if this is mandatory or not, but we didn't want to take any chances and the Bank provides this service free of charge for Spouse... So why would we not. Again, we gave 12 months as requested, presumably so that they can match it with the Payslip Net Pay amounts each month. No issues there from our end other than maybe feeling we were doing too much. Spouse had a LOOOT of pages for 12 months so it felt excessive at the time as we were thinking they only need 6 months.

CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT

CONFIRMATION OF EMPLOYMENT ON OFFICIAL LETTERHEADED PAPERWORK - Had to get this from HR at Spouse's workplace. We initially gave them a list of requirements for the letter... However what we got in the end was actually super basic. It was literally a letter stating Job Role, Salary, Type of Contract (Perm) and Employment Start Date. This had us a little worried and when Spouse went back to HR, he was told that the company's policy is to ONLY provide the information they had already given us, nothing more and nothing less. We accepted that this was the best we was going to get and didn't dwell too much on this as we knew employment would likely be verified via HMRC along with the payslips.

P60 - Again, I think this was triggered by the incorrect Cat B assumption from the weirdly worded question we all know. Provided it anyway because why not, Spouse had it, UKVI asked for it, so Spouse uploaded it. I do not think this had any effect on the decision but I could be wrong.

**ACCOMMODATION**

TENANCY AGREEMENT - Pretty standard stuff, Spouse rents and lives in a one bedroom apartment and obviously had to evidence where we would be staying together. From what I've read, there was no need for a Property Inspection Report. This irked us a little bit and there is a lot of conflicting information however from what I understood, there only had to be clear evidence that the accommodation is NOT OVERCROWDED. Spouse already had Applicant down as a permitted occupier on the agreement months in advance as he knew there would be a time when this may become reality.

LETTER FROM LANDLORD - We thought we should just add this to strengthen the accommodation part of the application, we just asked our landlord to provide a letter confirming their approval of Applicant living with Spouse in said property on letterheaded paper. Landlord completed this within a few days and even used fancy words like \*exclusively occupies\* as well as commenting on the suitability of the apartment for a couple. Couldn't ask more for more really.

UTILITY BILLS - Energy Bills, Water Bills, all dated within last 3 months

**RELATIONSHIP**

MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WITH ENGLISH TRANSLATION - We had our Marriage Certificate translated and attested by an Advocate and Notary Public who is recognised and approved by the Bangladeshi Govt.

RELATIONSHIP PHOTOS - We provided 10 Photographs from our wedding which we organised as a separate dated section in our PDF as well as 31 additional photographs from various times in our relationship. Maybe overkill, but we wanted to evidence a strong genuine relationship.

RELATIONSHIP CALLS & TEXTS - This was a bit too personal for our liking, however we carefully curated a couple of screenshots for each month we spoke with each other. We chose to do did this after following what others in this community have had success with.

FLIGHT ITINARARIES & BOARDING STAMPS/PASSES - We added these to show we have met in person. (Spouse travelled to Bangladesh to see Applicant at least twice a year)

FINANCIAL REMITTANCE - We added payment receipts of remittances Spouse sent to Applicant to evidence financial support.

**COVER LETTER**

The Cover Letter was the pièce de résistance.

We broke it down into sections. Section 1, we wrote our entire relationship timeline highlighting the moments of importance in our relationship. Section 2 was the Financial Requirements, we wrote out our intentions of which category we would be applying under (Cat A), who Spouse was employed with, how much they were earning as well as doing the calculations for them using only SIX months payslips, **not** the 12 months they asked for. Section 3 was a section detailing the accommodation and how it is suitable for us. Section 4 was a little 'About Me' section regarding the Applicant. Section 5 was an affirmation of genuine intent, support for one another as well as what this application meant to both of us. The cover letter was our way of explaining how we meet all of the requirements. We did not leave any room for misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Every sentence was direct and clear cut in terms of addressing the necessary requirements we needed to meet.

Also, just so you have an idea of what we mean by doing the calculations... Here is an extract from our cover letter:

*""Annualised Income from Overtime and Enhanced Pay:*

*(£3434.69 / 6) x 12 = £6869.38*

*Total Gross Annual Salary:*

*£XXXXX.XX + £6869.38 = £XXXXX.XX""*

We made it clear, using the HO's own calculations, exactly how to calculate the figures in accordance with Category A. I'm sure they already know this but considering we selected the wrong options on the Categories question, we wanted to double down on the intention of applying under Category A.

And that is all of the evidence we provided.

We uploaded ALL files in a PDF Format. It was a bit of a nightmare trying to overcome the ""this file is infected with a virus"" message, however we found converting to PDF/A would allow the file to be uploaded. Our photographs had to be downscaled and compressed so that we could create a single PDF packed full with images, into a file that could satisfy the 5MB file size limit for uploading on VFSGlobal.  
The website does time out a lot so I urge you to just check the upload files page every time you log in and match it up with what you have in your desktop folder to see if they all have been uploaded correctly. We had a couple of uploads missed but on rechecking, we managed to identify and upload the files before Biometrics. It's crazy that the site doesn't even acknowledge any failed uploads!!! I named each file exactly what they were and in capital letters so that they can be easily identified by the decision maker. For example ""PAYSLIPS - SPOUSE'S NAME"" or ""BANK STATEMENTS - SPOUSE'S NAME"".

All in all, this was a very eye-opening experience, there were ups and downs, and the waiting felt like a lifetime, but we got there in the end. Some people may say we did too much, some may say we did quite little. I do not think there are right and wrong ways, but as the contributors say in this community, if you satisfy all of the requirements, and evidence exactly what the HO wants to see, you should have no problems.

The very best of luck to all those who are still waiting or yet to apply. I hope this post helps you as much as this community helped me.",2025-06-26T02:40:15,Agent47-Order66,23,12,spousevisauk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpouseVisaUk/comments/1lkoxti/approved_spouse_visa_standard_bangladesh/,"['evisa', 'spouse visa']","[APPROVED] Spouse VISA | Standard | Bangladesh 🎉 🎊 🥳 First things first, I genuinely believe that this could not have been done without help of all of the contributors in this community, so I want to give a **HUGEEE THANK YOU** to those who answered questions, those who shared their journeys and even those who are simply asking the questions. Every interaction has been beneficial.

When we started this journey, we had no idea where to go, who to ask or even what to do. All we knew was that there was a process - A process we was not familiar with.

We initially started trawling through Appendix FM and the Immigration Rules and honestly... It did more harm than good. It confused us, it made us start to worry, at this point, we were considering getting a solicitor. After googling a few solicitors and researching the task at hand, I miraculously ended up in r/SpouseVisaUk.

After a few days of reading hundreds and hundreds of posts, our confidence grew, we began understanding what we failed to understand before. This community helped us become proficient at understanding what was required of us and how to present our evidence.

We decided not get a solicitor in the end because we began to have so much faith in ourselves, it didn't feel right to hand over this responsibility to anyone else. We thought that if anyone was going to take great care and evaluate every little detail in the application, it would be us, the Applicant and the Spouse.

And so we jumped straight in, into the deep end, with ourselves and just this amazing community to look towards for help 😅

Here is our timeline:

APPLICATION DATE - 14th May 2025  
BIOMETRICS DATE VIA VFSGLOBAL SYLHET - 18th May 2025  
ECO EMAIL - 23rd May 2025  
<We did not receive any Automatic Updates>  
APPROVAL EMAIL - 25th June 2025 @ 16:07 BST  
PASSPORT READY FOR COLLECTION - 1st July 2025  
PASSPORT COLLECTED - 2nd July 2025  
(Vignette Inside with 3 Months Validity for Entry Clearance)

We received a decision in line with what is expected to be 75% of applicants as shown in u/Ravendorr's post on Percentile Data of Application Decisions.

22 Working Days from ECO | 27 Working Days from BIO

33 Total Days from ECO | 38 Total Days from BIO

We provided the following evidence:

**CORE DOCUMENTATION**

APPLICANTS' PASSPORT - We started panicking as we only uploaded the Bio and Data pages and nothing else. We had seen people had stated they uploaded Blank Pages of their passport after we had already submitted ours. At this point, we just thought if they need it, they may ask for it. There isn't anything of importance in blank pages but this had us panicking for 2 or 3 days before we just came to terms with it. We actually forgot about this blunder again when the ECO email came asking that if there was anything else we should provide, we would have 5 days to do it in. This didn't even cross my mind when ECO came. Now that we received approval, I think of my initial thought of ""why do they need blank pages uploaded"". Maybe they don't, who knows...

SPOUSE'S PASSPORT - This was straightforward, British Passport Bio Page and Data Page

APPROVED ENGLISH SPEAKING TEST RESULTS - We provided an IELTS A1 Life Skills Test Result Form which had the UKVI Number on it.

PRE-DEPARTURE TB MEDICAL EXAMINATION CERTIFICATE - Another straightforward piece of paperwork, all applicant did was attend an IOM facility for medical screening in Sylhet and then picked up the results a few days later.

**FINANCIAL**

12 MONTHS PAYSLIPS - We applied under Category A however Spouse had fluctuating Gross Pay amounts due to overtime and bonus payments. We incorrectly selected ""Not the same amount continuously, above the financial requirement amount"". After submission, we realised that maybe we could have selected ""The same amount continuously, above the financial requirement amount"" option. In reality, Spouse did have the same (fixed) salary amount each month (if you don't include the overtime and bonus) but when we was applying, we chose the most appropriate answer, or what we both thought to have been the 'correct' answer. When selecting this option, I think the application assumes Cat B, therefore we were requested to provide 12 months payslips which we did not mind providing. We made it extremely clear in our cover letter exactly which category we were intending to apply under as to not cause any confusion on the Decision Makers' end.

12 MONTHS BANK STATEMENTS - We provided 12 months Bank Statements, with Digital 'True Copy' Certifications on every page from Spouse's bank. We aren't sure if this is mandatory or not, but we didn't want to take any chances and the Bank provides this service free of charge for Spouse... So why would we not. Again, we gave 12 months as requested, presumably so that they can match it with the Payslip Net Pay amounts each month. No issues there from our end other than maybe feeling we were doing too much. Spouse had a LOOOT of pages for 12 months so it felt excessive at the time as we were thinking they only need 6 months.

CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT

CONFIRMATION OF EMPLOYMENT ON OFFICIAL LETTERHEADED PAPERWORK - Had to get this from HR at Spouse's workplace. We initially gave them a list of requirements for the letter... However what we got in the end was actually super basic. It was literally a letter stating Job Role, Salary, Type of Contract (Perm) and Employment Start Date. This had us a little worried and when Spouse went back to HR, he was told that the company's policy is to ONLY provide the information they had already given us, nothing more and nothing less. We accepted that this was the best we was going to get and didn't dwell too much on this as we knew employment would likely be verified via HMRC along with the payslips.

P60 - Again, I think this was triggered by the incorrect Cat B assumption from the weirdly worded question we all know. Provided it anyway because why not, Spouse had it, UKVI asked for it, so Spouse uploaded it. I do not think this had any effect on the decision but I could be wrong.

**ACCOMMODATION**

TENANCY AGREEMENT - Pretty standard stuff, Spouse rents and lives in a one bedroom apartment and obviously had to evidence where we would be staying together. From what I've read, there was no need for a Property Inspection Report. This irked us a little bit and there is a lot of conflicting information however from what I understood, there only had to be clear evidence that the accommodation is NOT OVERCROWDED. Spouse already had Applicant down as a permitted occupier on the agreement months in advance as he knew there would be a time when this may become reality.

LETTER FROM LANDLORD - We thought we should just add this to strengthen the accommodation part of the application, we just asked our landlord to provide a letter confirming their approval of Applicant living with Spouse in said property on letterheaded paper. Landlord completed this within a few days and even used fancy words like \*exclusively occupies\* as well as commenting on the suitability of the apartment for a couple. Couldn't ask more for more really.

UTILITY BILLS - Energy Bills, Water Bills, all dated within last 3 months

**RELATIONSHIP**

MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WITH ENGLISH TRANSLATION - We had our Marriage Certificate translated and attested by an Advocate and Notary Public who is recognised and approved by the Bangladeshi Govt.

RELATIONSHIP PHOTOS - We provided 10 Photographs from our wedding which we organised as a separate dated section in our PDF as well as 31 additional photographs from various times in our relationship. Maybe overkill, but we wanted to evidence a strong genuine relationship.

RELATIONSHIP CALLS & TEXTS - This was a bit too personal for our liking, however we carefully curated a couple of screenshots for each month we spoke with each other. We chose to do did this after following what others in this community have had success with.

FLIGHT ITINARARIES & BOARDING STAMPS/PASSES - We added these to show we have met in person. (Spouse travelled to Bangladesh to see Applicant at least twice a year)

FINANCIAL REMITTANCE - We added payment receipts of remittances Spouse sent to Applicant to evidence financial support.

**COVER LETTER**

The Cover Letter was the pièce de résistance.

We broke it down into sections. Section 1, we wrote our entire relationship timeline highlighting the moments of importance in our relationship. Section 2 was the Financial Requirements, we wrote out our intentions of which category we would be applying under (Cat A), who Spouse was employed with, how much they were earning as well as doing the calculations for them using only SIX months payslips, **not** the 12 months they asked for. Section 3 was a section detailing the accommodation and how it is suitable for us. Section 4 was a little 'About Me' section regarding the Applicant. Section 5 was an affirmation of genuine intent, support for one another as well as what this application meant to both of us. The cover letter was our way of explaining how we meet all of the requirements. We did not leave any room for misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Every sentence was direct and clear cut in terms of addressing the necessary requirements we needed to meet.

Also, just so you have an idea of what we mean by doing the calculations... Here is an extract from our cover letter:

*""Annualised Income from Overtime and Enhanced Pay:*

*(£3434.69 / 6) x 12 = £6869.38*

*Total Gross Annual Salary:*

*£XXXXX.XX + £6869.38 = £XXXXX.XX""*

We made it clear, using the HO's own calculations, exactly how to calculate the figures in accordance with Category A. I'm sure they already know this but considering we selected the wrong options on the Categories question, we wanted to double down on the intention of applying under Category A.

And that is all of the evidence we provided.

We uploaded ALL files in a PDF Format. It was a bit of a nightmare trying to overcome the ""this file is infected with a virus"" message, however we found converting to PDF/A would allow the file to be uploaded. Our photographs had to be downscaled and compressed so that we could create a single PDF packed full with images, into a file that could satisfy the 5MB file size limit for uploading on VFSGlobal.  
The website does time out a lot so I urge you to just check the upload files page every time you log in and match it up with what you have in your desktop folder to see if they all have been uploaded correctly. We had a couple of uploads missed but on rechecking, we managed to identify and upload the files before Biometrics. It's crazy that the site doesn't even acknowledge any failed uploads!!! I named each file exactly what they were and in capital letters so that they can be easily identified by the decision maker. For example ""PAYSLIPS - SPOUSE'S NAME"" or ""BANK STATEMENTS - SPOUSE'S NAME"".

All in all, this was a very eye-opening experience, there were ups and downs, and the waiting felt like a lifetime, but we got there in the end. Some people may say we did too much, some may say we did quite little. I do not think there are right and wrong ways, but as the contributors say in this community, if you satisfy all of the requirements, and evidence exactly what the HO wants to see, you should have no problems.

1lk1dba,UK Spouse Visa from USA,"Hey y'all! I am from USA and will be submitting my application very soon from outside of the UK.

I am currently in the stage of building my relationship evidence and would love some guidance and opinions on what to include.

I'm assuming it's quality of quantity when it comes to photos. I'm very lost on what to screenshot when it comes to text messages & call logs. Does anyone have visual examples of what they've submitted that would be willing to share?  I think maybe actually seeing what someone else who has been through this would be super helpful and soothe my overthinking tendencies. Thanks in advance!

My partner will (finally) be applying in October for her spouse visa and we have heard horror stories and seen comments from people applying in Minsk and Moscow saying that the appointments in these cities are instantly booked by bots and sold to people that need them.

Is this common and who can I complain to if this happens? I've tried contacting VFS directly but their outsourced customer service is beyond useless and I'm told they have security guards outside the centres that don't let you in without an appointment?

I am meeting the accommodation requirements via my husband's uncle giving permission for my husband and I to stay with them temporarily.

Once I have a visa, I will be added to the tenancy as I'll be able to pass a right to rent check. All four of us will be living at this property initially.

1likdtm,"Application submitted, VFS is ATROCIOUS","(Warning - long read, detailed description of failure points of VFS system when attempting self-upload, apologies.)

My husband (US Citizen) and I (UK Citizen) applied two days ago for his spouse visa so that we can move to the UK.  We selected **standard** via application, we are doing **self-upload** of documents, and we selected **PRIORITY** from within the VFS system because we want to get an answer soon.  We have spent about two years researching everything and getting all of our documentation and finances in order for this application.  I am very OCD and so I had a pretty deeply-nested folder system of all of our documents to be uploaded.

In all, the UKVI website side of things went pretty smoothly.  We were able to just go at our own pace and fill out everything it asked for.  It is helpful that you can go online and create a dummy application weeks or months earlier so that you can learn what data they will be asking for.  

However - as soon as the application was completed and submitted (and fees paid), we ran into problems.  Basically, **VFS**.  I know that many on here are aware of them and their reputation - as we were, to a certain degree.  However, the extent of trauma that VFS' system brings to the visa application process - we found - is *incalculable*.  The UKVI application took about three hours - and then we spent probably the next 18hrs fighting to get our supporting documentation uploaded to VFS' system.  

For anyone else who is intending on applying soon and trying to ensure they get all of their stuff sorted out, I wanted to list here major known issues that we encountered within VFS' system:

1. After submitting your visa application to UKVI, you end up at a landing page where you can download a copy of your completed application (**DO.  THIS.  FIRST!!**), Also a button you can click to proceed to scheduling your biometrics appointment.  Of course we proceeded to click that button, as it is the next required step.  When you do this, it does NOT open in a new window.  It WILL open the VFS site/portal directly over your UKVI page that is still open.  Ensure you are fully finished with downloading your saved application in case you have issues logging back in to UKVI to retrieve it at a later date.
2. When you click out to the VFS portal to begin scheduling your biometrics appointment (we all agree that this is an Important Thing©), it will immediately take you into your account (that you didn't know you have already) within VFS' system.  There is NO introduction to the portal, no registration process or ""please create your account"" welcome message - nothing.  It takes you to a random screen that handshakes immediately with your GWF Reference Number (that you haven't been introduced to yet), and shoves you into biometrics appointment scheduling.  
3. When attempting to schedule your biometrics appointment at your nearest center, I would **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** that you use the most reliable and mainstream credit card you can.  The chances are that this will be the credit card that is sitting in your lap that has just been beaten up by the UKVI and IHS charges.  With us - this was the case - and it also proved one of the main sources of trauma we experienced during this whole process.  I would also recommend that - prior to beginning this application process - that you call said credit card company and request that they remove ALL security measures from you card for the 24-48hr period during which you will be applying.  We attempted to use a Wells Fargo Visa card within VFS' system for the biometrics appointment (and associated PRIORITY charge), and it immediately attempted to do an authentication/2FA check with the WF app on our phone.  The authentication check succeeded on our phone, but VFS's jank-filled system barfed and went to a blank screen that only had a ""Close"" button I could click.  After clicking that, it took us to another random blankish screen that simply said ""it is taking longer to verify your credit card transaction"" (or something like that).  It sat at that *forever*, with ZERO other options on the screen.  Just a dead VFS logo at the top-left that you can't even click on.  We proceeded to freak the hell out for those 30 mins.  We checked the WF app for the charge- nothing.  We called WF - all they saw was the two UKVI charges and nothing was hung up in security.  I literally sat on the verge of tears while my husband researched this glitch on all immigration forums he's been a member of for the past three years.  About 30mins later, it FINALLY cleared itself, returned us to our (as of yet unseen) VFS dashboard (hard learning curve), and showed a notification that the payment had failed for our biometrics appointment (and priority processing).  We then attempted to go back into the bio appt that was waiting for payment - however when we did that, we noticed that it had completely ERASED our priority processing selection (which is VERY important to us).  Not only that, but the option to toggle regular-vs-priority was now *broken* on the page for our existing appointment, leaving us entirely unable to reselect priority.  We ended up having to take our lives in our hands and CANCEL the existing bio appointment, and then proceed warily through it all again, selecting the same date and time and priority processing, and then used a different credit card.  It worked that time - about 45minutes and two migraines after.
4. After recovering from that mess and going out for some food, later that evening we began the process of uploading documents.  VFS' self-upload facility is ATROCIOUS.  I was aware that they were going to provide a number of catch-all categories - but the actual product is ABYSMAL.  Multiple categories for 'education' and 'employment', but zero indication where to attach things such as evidence of marriage, comingled finances, or even copies of passports.  
5. VFS' document upload file size is limited to 5MB **PER UPLOAD**, not per file as we were led to believe.  You can select several files at once (i.e. if you are doing monthly bank statements), but they must ALL total less than 5MB.  This makes uploading photographs (such as evidence of marriage) VERY laborious, as most photos (unless ran through software to downsize them), are 3-5MB a piece.  Bank statements with logos or fliers attached can be large also.  Multi-page documents such as mortgage paperwork can (and WILL) exceed the file size CONTINUALLY.  Make sure to sign up for a free Adobe Pro trial during your application timeframe so you can make changes to PDFs on the fly while trying to upload.
6. You WILL encounter several errors within VFS' portal.  It will not sensibly inform you of these errors, and in most cases the error message itself will either not appear or it will not specify WHICH of your files the error message pertains to.  **Errors you will encounter include:  File Name Already Exists; File is Virus Infected!; File Size Exceeds 5MG Limit.**  The absolute worst one is ""File is Virus Infected!"" - this means that some (or all, or a few - who knows!) of your PDFs are created with digital signatures or other security software that VFS' system is rejecting.  It does NOT mean your files have viruses!  This particularly applies to PDFs downloaded directly from a provider's website - so think bank statements, insurance bills, utility bills, etc. etc.  As these items were the MAJORITY of what we were attempting to provide to prove our marriage, we were met with this error time and time again - like, probably on up to 50 files.  I ended up having to spend the majority of the weekend hunched over my laptop having to resave a TON of our evidence files via the ""Print to PDF"" function.  This is the ONLY way to get around it and simply using Adobe to merge, compress or do something else to them will NOT work.  
7. You WILL completely, irrevocably, and wholly lose track of your file upload process.  VFS' system dumps them into whatever category you select, in absolutely zero order.  Everything will be scattered to the winds, and you are going to have a VERY hard time of it verifying that you have uploaded everything.
8. Do NOT attempt to verify all your documents are there BEFORE saving your upload at the bottom of the page!  VFS' system pushes through **one** time-out warning (where you can click 'stay logged in'), while you are queuing files to upload - then, after that (and at random unspecified moments) it will COMPLETELY log you out.  No option to stay logged in, nothing.  It will log you out DURING uploads (it did to us).  DO NOT attempt to do more than ten or so files without saving the current upload, returning to your dashboard, completely logging out of their system, closing your browser, and then restarting the whole process again - because you will lose ALL of your work.  This will happen repeatedly.  Ensure you have a bookmarked way to get back to the log-in, or use it from the email you get sent after your application is submitted.
9. You ARE able to save a few files and then return back in to your document upload center again and again.  This is good - HOWEVER, know that once files have been saved and uploaded in this manner, you are no longer able to preview the files to ensure that they stayed legible and are what you intended.  If you must, preview your queued files quickly BEFORE going to the bottom and saving them.  Again - once saved, they are protected from being lost on one of the timeouts or error messages, BUT you will no longer be able to preview them to check and double-check they're there in good order. 

If anything else comes to my mind, I will include it - but I at least want others who are preparing to apply to be aware of the system that they are about to have to navigate.

1lih27j,Meeting UK Spouse Visa Financial Requirement Without Early Withdrawal – Anyone Navigated This?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently in the process of applying for a UK spouse visa and had a question I hoped someone here could help me with. I've been trying to satisfy the financial requirement, specifically the cash savings route, but I’m running into a dilemma.

Most of my funds are tied up in U.S.-based accounts—some are retirement accounts or longer-term investments that would incur penalties or losses if I were to withdraw them now. I *do* have enough money on paper, but transferring or cashing out these funds just to have them sit in a UK bank for 6 months feels inefficient and costly.

A few questions for those who’ve been through this:

* Has anyone successfully used U.S.-based investment accounts like 401k, Roth IRA etc to meet the financial requirements?
* Were you able to *show* proof of access to funds without actually withdrawing them? I recently withdrew a large amount of money and put into my saving account, then was promptly told its lowest balance was x even though I had the money in the account, does this mean I just have to wait 6 months? 
* This seems silly as the money has been in my account for years and has been in cash for more than 6 months, not investments, cash... 
* If you *did* have to withdraw funds, how did you avoid penalties (or did you just bite the bullet)?
* Are there any alternatives or lesser-known approaches that the Home Office accepts for proving financial stability?

I’m married to a British citizen and we’re planning to move to the UK soon. I’d love to hear how others navigated this part of the process.

Thanks in advance—really appreciate any insight or shared experiences.

I’m Italian with settled status. My wife (Brazilian) got pre-settled in 2021. We've been together since 2017, living together since 11/2019 (first in Malta, then UK from Aug 2020). We planned to marry before 31 Dec 2020 — gave notice, but COVID restrictions (Denmark/Malta) delayed the ceremony. We finally married in Jan 2021.

Now the Home Office says she doesn't qualify for settled status because the marriage happened after the deadline. They say:

>

We had already submitted documents showing the COVID delays and our intent to marry before the deadline. They’re asking for either:

* Marriage cert dated before 31 Dec 2020 (which we don’t have), or
* Evidence of a “durable relationship” and dependency

Anyone been through this? Does giving notice before the deadline + proof of delay help?

We planned to marry before 31 Dec 2020 — gave notice, but COVID restrictions (Denmark/Malta) delayed the ceremony. We finally married in Jan 2021.

Now the Home Office says she doesn't qualify for settled status because the marriage happened after the deadline. They say:

>

We had already submitted documents showing the COVID delays and our intent to marry before the deadline. They’re asking for either:

* Marriage cert dated before 31 Dec 2020 (which we don’t have), or
* Evidence of a “durable relationship” and dependency

Anyone been through this? Does giving notice before the deadline + proof of delay help?

1lieuka,Question about accommodation,"For our partner visa we have put my parents address as there is ample room and it meets the requirements, this is also partly so that money isn't wasted on renting while waiting for the application to be approved. We are able to stay here, we are not being dishonest in anyway. However it is not our long term plan. The intention is to get our own flat.

I plan to start looking for a flat once the visa is approved, most likely she would come and stay at my parents household immediately but if by chance we find a flat very quickly, does this effect our application in anyway? In particular, I am aware that she will have to apply for an EVisa - will there be issues if we are applying for the E visa with a different address than we originally mentioned in our application?

1liefpm,Spouse Visa and 2 x Dependent Visas APPROVED - 59 Working Days,"Yalls, I nearly lost hope of ever seeing the UK, but today, approvals x 3 arrived.

1lhcxp2,Spouse Visa Outside UK (Standard) Approved,"Hi,

We got married on 20th December 2024, due to wedding costs it took some time to save up after for the visa application and IHS fee. I submitted the application on 1st May and the biometric appointment was on 13th May 2025. There was no ECO mail. On the morning of 13th June 2025 there was an email from UKVI that the visa had been approved. The passport with the visa vignette was delivered by courier on 21st June 2025.

VAC was Mirpur

Had chosen to get this done through lawyers to make sure everything went well. Realised after that it's not necessary, just do your research and you can get by fine. Here is what the lawyers sent for the requirements that they needed from me:

\-------------------  
Please find below list of documents for Spouse visa application for the UK. All documents must be COLOURED- SCANNED- PDF- A-4 SIZE

**Documents for the Applicant:**

1.        Passport copy of the applicant

2.        Birth certificate of the applicant

3.        Marriage certificate of the applicant and sponsor. (Original and English Translation)

4.        Tuberculosis screening certificate or **TB certificate of the Applicant. (required before submission of the Application**) 

5.        Applicant’s English language qualification at **A1 level** (IELTS).  

6.        Copy of British Passport of the Sponsor.  

7.        Applicant ID cards.

8.        Applicants Parents ID cards.

 **Sponsor’s employment and finances (Employed)**  

9.        Last 6/8-month salary slips.

10.      Last 6/8-month salary account bank statements.

11.      P-60 April 2024

12.      Employment contract.

13.      Letter from the employer confirmation of employment and salary etc **(We will provide the draft letter)**

14.      Sponsor declaration. **(We will provide)**

**Sponsor’s accommodation provisions**

 15.      House ownership copy of land registry and a letter from the house owner granting approval. **(We will provide the draft letter)**

 **Documents going to subsisting relationship.** 

 17.      Photographs of the applicant and sponsor both at the time of marriage (the ceremony) and other generic photographs in a family setting and outdoors after marriage. (15-20 pictures)

\-------------------

  
Due to not receiving an ECO mail I was getting worried and decided to do a paid enquiry on 5th June. I received an automated response: ""With regards to your enquiry about the status of your application, I can confirm that your application is being considered and is currently awaiting a decision.""

It was getting tiresome so I sent followups asking for specifics about if the case was assigned or not, I finally got through to someone who gave me an answer that an ECO had been assigned at Sheffield. Not sure if this helped speed up the process as I was worried about my application collecting dust.

I sent 6 month bank statements and payslips.

On the application itself, although my salary is higher than what was in my P60 due to pay increases (from my employment letter and contract), my lawyer wrote the salary as my P60, and selected ""Not the same amount continuously, above the financial requirement amount"" on the ""What do they earn?"" question. When I asked him why he put the P60 salary he said when UKVI searches for your salary they will find what is on the P60.

1lgduxx,spouse visa timeline questions!,"Hi all,

My spouse is British and I had my spouse visa approved (from within UK, as I was switching from a graduate visa) in early December, which means it expires June 2027 (2 years 6 months) and I will need to apply for the extension of it in May 2027. I just have a few quick questions!

1. I was doing some digging but couldn't quite tell if there are any different rules and requirements for the extension/renewal of the spouse visa, or if it's literally just submitting all of the same things (proof we live together, our marriage certificate, our income/finances, etc) again or if there are any new kinds of documents we'd need to submit?

2. At the end of my spouse visa extension, I plan to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under the 5 year route. I can't remember where I read this but I seem to have a memory of needing to prove that you were in the UK on a certain date- maybe it was five years from your date of application for ILR, to prove you've been in the UK for exactly five years??- in order to submit your application, and I was wondering how on earth that works? Do you submit payslips or are you meant to have a photo of you outside your house or something? It feels so silly to ask and maybe I'm just making it up but if anyone knows what I'm talking about, please let me know! I don't want future me to be let down by current me :)

1lem8ll,"UK Spouse Visa - Success!! (Priority, Philippines)","Hello, everyone! I wanted to share our experience with the application process. I think our process was quite unique because we sent in additional supporting documents that we failed to submit for scanning through VFS even if we were not asked to do so. We did this because we thought our application lacked supporting documents :( 

The initial supporting documents that we submitted were so sparse compared to everyone else's! My husband and I only learned about this subreddit after my application and biometrics were submitted --- to say that it has been a nerve-wracking past few weeks is an understatement! 

Applied from VFS (Philippines) - paid for Priority Service 

* Application date: May 10th
* Bio date: May 26th --> opted for VFS to scan supporting documents
* ECO email: May 29th
* Sent additional documents that we wanted to add through ECO email instructions: June 3rd
* Approval email: June 18th

Our application was straightforward: husband is a British Citizen, his employment meets the financial threshold, has been in a long-distance relationship since 2019, got married last December 2024

**Initially**, we only submitted the following supporting documents (because I just stuck to what was on the checklist): 

**Sponsorship**

* Photocopy of Sponsor's Passport
* Employment Letter indicating his position, salary, and duration of employment 

**Proof of Relationship**

* Marriage Certificate
* 10-page PPT with timeline of our relationship, how we met, photos of our travels together, screenshots of our flights, hotel bookings, tours, photos of our families, photos of our wedding day
* (Shared Financial Responsibility) Bank Certificate of our Joint Bank Account
* (Shared Financial Responsibility) Screenshots of his Wise transfers to my bank account; corresponding amounts entering my bank account through my bank statement

**English Language Proficiency**

* ECCTIS letter that confirms my degree meets CEFR level B2
* School documents (Bachelor's Degree Diploma, Master's Degree Diploma, Certificate from my University indicating English as Medium of Instruction)

**My Passport**

*These were all the documents that I submitted.* I bet you would immediately notice that I didn't submit anything that showed sufficient accommodations or proof of my husband's income. At this point, my husband and I were nervous wrecks! We felt so unprepared. We combed through the internet until we stumbled on a post from years ago that said they sent additional documents through the details provided in the ECO Email. 

We opted to follow this advice and followed Option 3 in the VFS Global Supporting Documents tab which shows the **""Step-by-step guide to sending documents for scanning by post""**. Since my husband was in the UK, he sent the following additional documents:

**Accommodations**

* Proof of Home Ownership of his parents
* Invitation letter from his parents indicating that we can stay with them
* Photocopy of his parents' passports

**Sponsorship**

* last 6 months payslip 
* bank statements showing the corresponding payslip amounts entering his account
* Letter from my husband indicating he will support me

**Misc**

* Cover letter indicating that these additional documents *supplement* the initial supporting documents we have already submitted with VFS 

Husband posted these items along with the cover page of my application letter + sworn declaration. He received the documents a few days later with additional barcode separators; suggesting that the recipient went through the documents. **However, we didn't receive any feedback if these documents were added to our application.** 

We don't really know if the additional documents that we sent to the VFS Scanning Hub in the UK helped our application, or if our application would have been approved even without these additional documents. But I thought it would be helpful to share it here in case anyone is on the same boat. :)

(Priority, Philippines) Hello, everyone! I wanted to share our experience with the application process. I think our process was quite unique because we sent in additional supporting documents that we failed to submit for scanning through VFS even if we were not asked to do so. We did this because we thought our application lacked supporting documents :( 

The initial supporting documents that we submitted were so sparse compared to everyone else's! My husband and I only learned about this subreddit after my application and biometrics were submitted --- to say that it has been a nerve-wracking past few weeks is an understatement! 

Applied from VFS (Philippines) - paid for Priority Service 

* Application date: May 10th
* Bio date: May 26th --> opted for VFS to scan supporting documents
* ECO email: May 29th
* Sent additional documents that we wanted to add through ECO email instructions: June 3rd
* Approval email: June 18th

Our application was straightforward: husband is a British Citizen, his employment meets the financial threshold, has been in a long-distance relationship since 2019, got married last December 2024

**Initially**, we only submitted the following supporting documents (because I just stuck to what was on the checklist): 

**Sponsorship**

* Photocopy of Sponsor's Passport
* Employment Letter indicating his position, salary, and duration of employment 

**Proof of Relationship**

* Marriage Certificate
* 10-page PPT with timeline of our relationship, how we met, photos of our travels together, screenshots of our flights, hotel bookings, tours, photos of our families, photos of our wedding day
* (Shared Financial Responsibility) Bank Certificate of our Joint Bank Account
* (Shared Financial Responsibility) Screenshots of his Wise transfers to my bank account; corresponding amounts entering my bank account through my bank statement

**English Language Proficiency**

* ECCTIS letter that confirms my degree meets CEFR level B2
* School documents (Bachelor's Degree Diploma, Master's Degree Diploma, Certificate from my University indicating English as Medium of Instruction)

**TB Test**

I'm in the UK and my wife is Russian, she has applied for a UK spouse visa and we are at the stage of trying to book a biometrics appointment with VFS Global. However, for weeks and weeks we have been trying day and night and the website just won't work. 

Most of the time it fails with an error. And when we can finally select an appointment, of which there are very few if any, it won't let us book it - it times out with another error after loading for 2-3 minutes.

1ldm83t,"Spouse visa , outside UK checklist","Hello community 👋 I hope to get some advice on my second spouse visa application. In particular I want to double check all my documents before my biometrics in 2 days time. 

So long story short here is our situation. We are married since November 2024, my husband works in IT and has basically moved in with me in Romania since February 2024 as he can work remotely. He earns well above the threshold and is a dual citizen (UK and Romanian). He has been employed at the same company for 5 years plus. 

The first time the visa was refused as I took the wrong English test 🤦🏻 went for Cambridge instead of IELTS. The second reason was because in the evidence we only provided the marriage certificate and the officer didn’t believe we ever met in person and are in a genuine relationship. The rest of the application was fine back then as it was stated in the decision letter. 

Now onto the second application which we are about to provide biometrics for. I have provided the correct ielts speaking and listening for UKVI at A1 level. And for the relationship I have provided again the marriage certificate, multiple flight tickets  with both our names on them and some separate ones from when we have visited each other and also him visiting me as well as times we went on holidays together (4 holidays abroad together). We also attached bookings from hotels , about 20 pictures ranging from when we met until today, a letter explaining our timeline since we met , 2 witness statements from one of my friends and one of his friends as well as bank statements in his name , showing he withdrew money and paid at Lidl in Romania , in my home town all from different months. 

Our Accomodation in the uk is as follows. He has a mortgage in his name for a house with 3 bedrooms and a living room and has 3 lodgers (a married couple and their 14 year old son). We provided a copy of the contract of sale and a bank statement from the mortgage provider from the past 12 months, stamped by the bank. 

For his employment we provided 12 months payslips, a letter from the employment to show his title , salary , type of employment (permanent) and since when he was employed. Also provided bank statements from his bank where his salary is paid for the last 6 months. 

The rest of the application is the same as last time, just with the latest documents so that they are up to date. 

In my head everything is ok but I just wanted to get some reassurance and if advice if I can include anything else. Obviously having been refused once already made me second guess every stop of the application and every document.

For me, the most stressful part was preparing for the civics test, where there are 100 questions of which any 10 of which can be asked at the interview. I wanted something I could quickly review on my phone, ideally in flashcard format. But I couldn’t find a free tool that didn’t require installing an app or making an account.

What it does: (1) fully browser-based and works on mobile and desktop. No download, no login; (2) randomized flashcards of the official 100 USCIS questions; (3) tracks what you get wrong, so you can review those only.

1mcf78a,Dilemma of removal order,"Hi r/immigration,
I’m stuck in a tough spot with my immigration case and need your advice. I entered the U.S. on an F-1 visa post-COVID but couldn’t start school that fall. I filed for asylum due to genuine dangers in my home country. I graduated in 2024 and married my U.S. citizen spouse in March 2025. While preparing to file an I-130 and I-485, I discovered an in absentia removal order from May 2025. I never received a Notice to Appear (NTA) or any notice, likely due to an old address.
I couldn’t afford an attorney’s $20k fee, so I filed a pro se appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in June 2025 to preserve my case—it’s still pending. My asylum-based EAD was revoked, and I only have an I-130 receipt. I’m frustrated and unsure what to do. Here’s my dilemma:
•  Should I file a motion to reopen with the BIA, since my appeal is pending there?
•  Or should I withdraw the BIA appeal and file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge (IJ)? Someone told me appeals of in absentia orders must start with the IJ, and my appeal might be dismissed/denied for lack of jurisdiction! 
•  My marriage and I-130 could support adjusting my status’s, but the removal order complicates things.
Has anyone dealt with this? Should I focus on the lack of notice for the removal order or my marriage as grounds to reopen? Any advice on navigating this mess would mean a lot.

1mc3f4c,URGENT: International bachelor’s student. US visa revoked. Got into ANU Australia. Still waiting on student visa approval. Out of time and options. Please help,"Hi everyone,

I’m honestly at my breaking point and need help, advice, support, anything right now. Time is running out fast and I’ve done everything I possibly could.

I’m an international student pursuing a bachelor’s degree. I was studying in the US for the past two years and had completed my sophomore year, but due to unfortunate circumstances, my SEVIS was terminated and my US visa got revoked. That alone was devastating but I refused to give up on my education.

I applied to universities in Australia and got accepted into Australian National University ANU, one of the top universities in the country. They accepted most of my US credits and I was beyond relieved. I’ve already
• Paid my first semester’s full tuition
• Enrolled in my classes
• Secured my accommodation

The classes officially started on July 21st, but I requested a delay due to visa issues and the university kindly gave me an extension until August 4th.

The problem
I applied for my Australian student visa almost a month ago and there’s still no update. No approval, no decision, just complete silence.
I even reached out to the Australian Embassy to try and expedite the process but I’ve received no response. I’m now completely out of ideas and the August 4th deadline is just days away.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if ANU will give me another extension. I don’t know if I can request to start classes online somehow while I wait for the visa. I don’t even know who to contact anymore. But this is my dream. I’ve already lost one chance in the US and I can’t afford to lose this too.

I’ve done everything right
• My documents were complete
• I have good academic standing
• No criminal record
• A strong study plan
• Everything paid and ready to go

Please if anyone has gone through this before or knows what I can do, I’d be so grateful for your help. Even if you don’t, any advice, direction, or even emotional support would mean a lot to me right now.

Specifically, I’m desperate to know
• Is there any way to expedite the visa process at this point
• Can ANU allow further deferral or temporary online start until I get my visa
• Has anyone dealt with long student visa wait times from Australia recently
• Any official contacts or people who might help speed things up

Thank you to anyone who read this. I’ve worked so hard to hold onto my education and I feel like I’m watching it slip away again. Please help in any way you can. Even the smallest reply helps.

Posting this across relevant subreddits because I really don’t have time and I need advice fast.

1m3d426,I came to Germany as a student without a clear plan – now I might be exmatriculated again. Can I reapply for a visa later if I leave voluntarily?,"I came to Germany in June 2023. At the time, I was very excited and hopeful. But the truth is, I came without a real plan. I just wanted to leave my country. I didn't take things seriously, especially regarding my studies and discipline.  
The only thing I was good at was working. I had no problems with it, and I loved being responsible. But I came on a student visa, so studying had to be my priority, even if I needed to work to support myself financially.  
In September 2023, the university required me to pass the A2 German language exam or I would be expelled from the university. I didn't pass, partly because I had just arrived in June, partly because it was difficult to get appointments, and partly because I was careless and lazy. So, I was expelled from the university just four months after arriving. According to the law, I was supposed to report to the Immigration Office (Ausländerbehörde) immediately within two weeks, but I didn't. I wanted to get a new admission before reporting them. I finally received a new university admission in March 2024 and reported it to the Immigration Office. However, they took away my residence permit and said that what I had done was illegal, and I should have reported it much earlier.

They did, however, accept the change of university, but under one strict condition: I am not allowed to change my program again. They granted me a new two-year residence permit, valid until May 2026.

I'm currently studying robotics, but honestly, I'm having a really hard time. It's very difficult for me; I study a lot of math, electronics, and programming. I've failed several exams. I swear I've really changed after my first mistake in 2023. I've become more serious this year, but this program simply isn't for me.

Now, due to my failing exams, I may be expelled from the university again in September or October.

So I have some questions, and I would appreciate any advice, especially from anyone who has gone through a similar experience:

Is it better to voluntarily leave the program and return home (for personal reasons), rather than waiting for the university to expel me again?

If I return home and study German diligently (because I was studying in English before), can I reapply for a student visa in the future, perhaps for a program that suits me perfectly?

Can I reapply for a visa later if I leave voluntarily? I came to Germany in June 2023. At the time, I was very excited and hopeful. But the truth is, I came without a real plan. I just wanted to leave my country. I didn't take things seriously, especially regarding my studies and discipline.  
The only thing I was good at was working. I had no problems with it, and I loved being responsible. But I came on a student visa, so studying had to be my priority, even if I needed to work to support myself financially.  
In September 2023, the university required me to pass the A2 German language exam or I would be expelled from the university. I didn't pass, partly because I had just arrived in June, partly because it was difficult to get appointments, and partly because I was careless and lazy. So, I was expelled from the university just four months after arriving. According to the law, I was supposed to report to the Immigration Office (Ausländerbehörde) immediately within two weeks, but I didn't. I wanted to get a new admission before reporting them. I finally received a new university admission in March 2024 and reported it to the Immigration Office. However, they took away my residence permit and said that what I had done was illegal, and I should have reported it much earlier.

They did, however, accept the change of university, but under one strict condition: I am not allowed to change my program again. They granted me a new two-year residence permit, valid until May 2026.

I'm currently studying robotics, but honestly, I'm having a really hard time. It's very difficult for me; I study a lot of math, electronics, and programming. I've failed several exams. I swear I've really changed after my first mistake in 2023. I've become more serious this year, but this program simply isn't for me.

Now, due to my failing exams, I may be expelled from the university again in September or October.

So I have some questions, and I would appreciate any advice, especially from anyone who has gone through a similar experience:

Is it better to voluntarily leave the program and return home (for personal reasons), rather than waiting for the university to expel me again?

If I return home and study German diligently (because I was studying in English before), can I reapply for a student visa in the future, perhaps for a program that suits me perfectly?

What should I write in my next visa application if I want to return to Germany after preparing well? Can I just say that I left for personal reasons, learned from my experience, and now have a better plan?

I can add some things to my advantage, such as the fact that I volunteered several times, and also add a reason for returning with evidence, such as a certificate stating that my mother was ill (which is true) and that I had to take care of her.

1m1zkik,F1 visa denied under 214(b) in Seoul for my wife (Korean citizen) — what went wrong?,"**Edit:** *Wishing everyone good luck and a bit more patience with each other on these topics. I won’t be checking replies going forward, as the thread seems to have reached its constructive limits. Thanks to those who offered genuine insight and helped me better understand the situation — we’ll likely pivot and plan for universities in other countries, as U.S. schools seem a bad fit due to my citizenship status. Cheers for your time.*

My (U.S. citizen) wife (Korean citizen) was denied her F1 visa in Seoul under 214(b). She is currently enrolled at a top 25 global university in the States; we already have student housing established, and she was awarded a scholarship from her school. Her semester is set to begin in late July.

We have been married and living in Korea for nearly ten years — at no point have we made any effort to immigrate to the States, applied for an I-130, etc. Neither of us have any interest in moving to America. She has no history of staying in America for long periods of time, only visiting every few years to see family.

She decided to pursue her MA in her field and was admitted to a handful of top-tier U.S. universities on scholarships. She selected among those the one that best fits her career goals.

We have significant financial assets in Korea, property under her name, as well as a business filed under both our names.

I’m extremely confused about what could have led to her 214(b) denial.

If we wanted to immigrate, we could have just applied for the I-130 — there is no reason to needlessly jump through the hoops of the F1 process if that was our intention. Neither of us has any desire to permanently relocate to America.

Some complications: her sister is in the States on a student visa. Again, I am a U.S. citizen and have family in the States.

Nothing really beyond that.

From what my wife recounted, they asked her about her school of choice, her study plans, what I do/have done in Korea, what I intend to do in the States, and then they proffered the denial form.

Her semester begins in 10 days. Again, we already have student housing, scholarships, and funding in place, and have done everything by the books.

She has made a second appointment and scheduled to meet with consultants in hopes that we can get another shot at approval — otherwise, we will have to defer her enrollment for a year. I can’t understand why she’d be denied; as I said, we could have applied for an I-130 at any point in the last decade if that was our intention.

It’s infuriating to think that we could be forced to defer enrollment because of this judgment. Beyond that, I can’t make sense of a situation where I’m somehow put in a position to file an I-130 — just so my wife can attend graduate school — when neither of us has any desire to stay in America. Isn’t that exactly why the F1 exists in the first place?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2025-07-17T05:47:53,,6,38,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1m1zkik/f1_visa_denied_under_214b_in_seoul_for_my_wife/,['student visa'],"F1 visa denied under 214(b) in Seoul for my wife (Korean citizen) — what went wrong? **Edit:** *Wishing everyone good luck and a bit more patience with each other on these topics.

1m1y0jd,Looking for advice for parents (63/54) 3rd attempt for B1/B2 visa interview - Hyd Consulate,"Hoping to get some guidance from folks who’ve been in similar situations or have experience with B1/B2 visa interviews for parents with multiple rejections.

My parents have had two visa refusals under section 214(b), both at a U.S. consulate outside their home country, where they've been living and working for over 15 years. They’re now planning to reapply from their home country (They're in the home country for a short summer visit).

This would be their third attempt, and I want to make sure they’re better prepared this time. Their intent is purely to visit family for a few weeks — no plans to immigrate.

A few general points:

* Long-term residents of a gulf country, but citizens of their home country (India).
* Both previous interviews were outside their home country (In the gulf).
* They have strong ties to their home country — properties and lands, retirement plans via rental income, etc.
* All their children are currently in the U.S. (mix of work and student visas).
* Got 214(b) refusals both times after routine questions.

My questions:

* Does applying from their home country vs. a third country make a difference?
* What can they do differently in their application or interview prep to better demonstrate strong ties?
* Has anyone had success after a 214(b) refusal — what changed between attempts?

1m0py2j,Student Visa: Is 992€/month blocked account enough despite tuition fees?,"Hey everyone,  
I’m currently applying for a student visa for a **dual study program at**  a university in Germany and was wondering if anyone has experience with this:

Is a **blocked account with 992€/month (11,904€ total for one year)** enough **even if there are additional monthly tuition fees**?  
In my case, the tuition is **670€/month at** the university, plus exam fees and other small costs.

I’ve already applied to many partner companies from abroad but haven’t had any luck so far.  
So my plan is to **enter Germany first with the visa**, and then **look for a partner company locally**. The university confirmed that once I’m there, they will support me in getting a work contract.

**Important to know:**  
If I find a company, they would **cover the tuition fees** and even give me **monthly pocket money/salary** — but I don’t have a contract yet.

👉 **Hint**: This isn’t a regular university program – it’s a **dual study program with tuition fee**s, and I’m still searching for a company. The university is okay with that and said I’ll get a contract once I arrive – but I’m not sure if that’s enough for the embassy.

I’m currently applying for a student visa for a **dual study program at**  a university in Germany and was wondering if anyone has experience with this:

Is a **blocked account with 992€/month (11,904€ total for one year)** enough **even if there are additional monthly tuition fees**?  
In my case, the tuition is **670€/month at** the university, plus exam fees and other small costs.

I’ve already applied to many partner companies from abroad but haven’t had any luck so far.  
So my plan is to **enter Germany first with the visa**, and then **look for a partner company locally**. The university confirmed that once I’m there, they will support me in getting a work contract.

**Important to know:**  
If I find a company, they would **cover the tuition fees** and even give me **monthly pocket money/salary** — but I don’t have a contract yet.

👉 **Hint**: This isn’t a regular university program – it’s a **dual study program with tuition fee**s, and I’m still searching for a company. The university is okay with that and said I’ll get a contract once I arrive – but I’m not sure if that’s enough for the embassy.

1lywvrr,Need help validating my immigration path,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 21F from India currently working in U.S. healthcare billing (RCM domain). I want to leave India **legally within 12 months**, not through a student visa, but by building a career that gets me into Canada via either PR or work permit.

I’ve selected the **Health Data Analyst / Revenue Cycle Analyst** path. I already have experience in medical billing and now I’m learning:
- Advanced Excel
- SQL
- Power BI
- Basics of healthcare analytics

Here’s my plan (please let me know if this sounds realistic):

✅ Get IELTS done (aiming 7+ band)  
✅ Apply for WES (I did BCA from Vanita Vishram University)  
✅ Build 2–3 small portfolio projects using healthcare data  
✅ Apply for Express Entry  
✅ While waiting, apply for jobs in Canada that offer LMIA  
✅ Move legally via PR or job sponsorship

I’ve seen some posts saying healthcare/analytics might be too saturated, but I’m willing to work really hard. I just want to know:

1. Does this seem like a solid 1-year plan?
2. Any risks with WES accepting a BCA from Vanita Vishram?
3. Is this role good for PR or job-based visa? Or should I consider switching fields completely?
4. Any advice from people who took a similar path?

Are the any countries out there you can pick your life up and go and then iron out the details of your residency through being there? Like become a student without needing several semesters worth of tuition??

1lxowk4,"""Just got my Green Card/US Visa after 4 years—here’s my journey!""(by help of ai just to say all the details )","Holy shit. It’s finally over. After 3 years, 2 RFEs, 1 canceled interview, and approximately 37 mental breakdowns, I’m holding my Green Card in my hands. Here’s the real, unfiltered story of what it took to get here – the good, the bad, and the downright ridiculous.

**The Timeline From Hell:**

* **March 2021:** Submitted I-130 (spouse visa) with a lawyer who promised ""12-18 months max!"" *Cue laugh track*
* **August 2021:** First RFE hits – USCIS claims we didn’t prove our marriage was real. Bro, we sent wedding photos, joint bank statements, leases, even our fucking Netflix account. Had to get notarized letters from friends and family saying ""yes, they’re really married.""
* **February 2022:** Case finally approved... only to disappear into the NVC black hole for 8 months. Radio silence.
* **October 2022:** Interview scheduled! Canceled 3 days before because of ""staffing shortages."" Got rescheduled 6 months later.
* **July 2024:** Woke up to a ""Case Approved"" notification. No interview. No warning. Just... done.

**The Absolute Worst Parts Nobody Talks About:**

1. **The USCIS Black Hole:** Going months without updates while your life is on hold. Calling them was like talking to a brick wall until I learned the magic words: ""outside normal processing time.""
2. **RFE Roulette:** Even with a $3k lawyer, we got hit with two RFEs. Pro tip: Whatever evidence your lawyer says is enough, double it. Triple it. Send them your childhood diaries if you have to.
3. **The Mental Toll:** Putting your life on pause for years – turning down jobs, not visiting family, delaying kids – because ""what if the visa comes through?""

**What Actually Helped (From Someone Who’s Been Through It):**

* **Document EVERYTHING:** Think you’ve sent enough proof? Send more. Wedding invites, text logs, photos with timestamps, joint Amazon Prime account – USCIS eats this shit up.
* **Be the Squeaky Wheel:** If your case is past processing time, call every day. Be polite but persistent. One Tier 2 officer finally moved our case after months of nothing.
* **Reddit/VisaJourney Saved Me:** The forums knew more than our lawyer. Crowdsourced knowledge is power.

**To Everyone Still Waiting:**  
I see you. I was you. The uncertainty is brutal, but it does end. Eventually. AMA about this nightmare process – happy to help others survive it.

And to USCIS: I never want to see another Form I- ever again. Peace out.

1lukp0z,Urgent: Victims of Family Violence Visa (or Alternatives) for 20yo Cousin Facing Gang Threats,"Hi everyone,
I’m seeking urgent advice for my cousin (20M) in South Africa who is trying to escape life-threatening gang coercion. Our uncle (a high-ranking gang leader in Cape Town) is violently pressuring him to join the gang. My cousin has refused because he’s a skilled football player with professional potential, but he’s now receiving death threats and is in hiding.

My entire immediate family (parents + myself) are NZ permanent residents. My dad previously sponsored my cousin’s NZ visitor visa (he visited NZ in the past and complied with all conditions).

His mother (a single parent) and grandmother cannot protect him—they live in extreme poverty in a high-risk area and fear retaliation. He has never been involved in gangs and is desperate to leave SA legally. I wanted to hear here first and know also what evidence we would need before enquiring. 
Questions:
1. Victims of Family Violence Work Visa: Given that my family are NZ PRs and he’s facing violence from a family member (uncle), could he qualify despite not being in NZ yet?
2. Alternative Pathways:
    * Given his prior visitor visa (sponsored by my dad), could we reapply and then seek protection?
    * Would a Humanitarian Visa or Refugee Status be possible given the documented threats?
3. Sponsorship: As PRs, can my family sponsor him for a work/student visa if we show financial support?

1lujhc2,Will legal migration to Europe ever stop or become heavily restricted?,"I'm wondering if legal migration to Europe from non-EU countries could eventually be stopped or become much more restricted.

I'm specifically talking about legal pathways like student visas and skilled worker programs not illegal migration or asylum seekers.

My concern comes from the recent rise of far-right parties across Europe. Even though most of the so-called “migration problem” is caused by illegal immigration and refugee crises, it’s often the legal migrants who end up being punished. For example, in the UK, despite the main issue being illegal migrants and asylum seekers, their response was to tighten restrictions on student and skilled worker visas.

I’m planning to migrate within the next three years, so this uncertainty worries me. I know predictions are never 100% accurate, but any informed thoughts or reassurance would really help.

1lu1aoy,For visual artists: what was your experience like applying for a work visa in the US and how feasible is it?,"I have 1.5 years left until I complete my undergrad program and I'm considering staying in the US to get my foot in the door the first 4 years. My plan is to apply for an OPT and try my best within a year but the odds are looking slim in this economy and political climate. I have another degree in literature/art studies that can apply to museum/curator jobs on top of my BFA. I know I want to get an mfa at some point but not before working independently for several years as an artist.

I've heard that it's been harder and harder to find sponsors for a H1B and for a O1B, I'm looking at at least $5k in legal consultant fees and admittedly, I don't think my work will garner the level of recognition necessary in 3 years time. 

I want to know:
- if I keep applying to residencies post grad - will this count towards my opt or will I have to apply for a student visa?
- are there people who had to pivot and find work elsewhere before returning to the states? (Your home country, UK, Europe, Australia) And what was that like?
- do you have successful stories of going from OPT to H1/O1? Were you able to find museum work or artist assistant jobs?
- what are your tips for success? I don't want to limit my opportunities to the US, knowing how cutthroat it can be so I'm hoping you could shed light on what it's like

1lt864m,Need urgent help: Should I pay tuition now for Hungary (University of Miskolc) if visa delays are likely from Pakistan?,"Hey everyone, I need some honest advice and insights from anyone who’s dealt with Hungarian student visas or studied in Hungary.

I’ve received a Conditional Letter of Acceptance from the University of Miskolc in Hungary for a Bachelor of Business Administration and Management program. The semester starts in September 2025, and the university is now asking me to pay:
	•	Tuition fee: €2,400
	•	Accommodation fee: €650
	•	Total: €3,050

Only after payment will they issue the Final Letter of Acceptance, which I need to apply for a D-type Hungarian student visa.

⸻

My concern:

I’m from Pakistan, and I’ve heard from multiple sources that Hungarian visa appointments are really limited or backlogged, especially during summer months before September intake. Some say you should apply 4–6 months in advance, but I just got my conditional offer now.

⸻

Questions I need help with:
	1.	Has anyone from Pakistan recently applied for a Hungarian student visa? How long did it take to get an appointment and visa?
	2.	Should I pay the fees now or wait until I confirm an appointment date?
	3.	Do consultancies or agents in Pakistan really help in getting earlier appointments?
	4.	If I can’t get a visa in time, does University of Miskolc allow deferrals to Spring 2026, and will they carry over my tuition?
	5.	Is the accommodation fee refundable or transferable if I defer?

Any personal experience, advice, or even just reassurance would mean a lot. I really want to go but don’t want to risk losing over €3,000.

1mc3gi6,URGENT: International bachelor’s student. US visa revoked. Got into ANU Australia. Still waiting on student visa approval. Out of time and options. Please help,"Hi everyone,

I’m honestly at my breaking point and need help, advice, support, anything right now. Time is running out fast and I’ve done everything I possibly could.

I’m an international student pursuing a bachelor’s degree. I was studying in the US for the past two years and had completed my sophomore year, but due to unfortunate circumstances, my SEVIS was terminated and my US visa got revoked. That alone was devastating but I refused to give up on my education.

I applied to universities in Australia and got accepted into Australian National University ANU, one of the top universities in the country. They accepted most of my US credits and I was beyond relieved. I’ve already
• Paid my first semester’s full tuition
• Enrolled in my classes
• Secured my accommodation

The classes officially started on July 21st, but I requested a delay due to visa issues and the university kindly gave me an extension until August 4th.

The problem
I applied for my Australian student visa almost a month ago and there’s still no update. No approval, no decision, just complete silence.
I even reached out to the Australian Embassy to try and expedite the process but I’ve received no response. I’m now completely out of ideas and the August 4th deadline is just days away.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if ANU will give me another extension. I don’t know if I can request to start classes online somehow while I wait for the visa. I don’t even know who to contact anymore. But this is my dream. I’ve already lost one chance in the US and I can’t afford to lose this too.

I’ve done everything right
• My documents were complete
• I have good academic standing
• No criminal record
• A strong study plan
• Everything paid and ready to go

Please if anyone has gone through this before or knows what I can do, I’d be so grateful for your help. Even if you don’t, any advice, direction, or even emotional support would mean a lot to me right now.

Specifically, I’m desperate to know
• Is there any way to expedite the visa process at this point
• Can ANU allow further deferral or temporary online start until I get my visa
• Has anyone dealt with long student visa wait times from Australia recently
• Any official contacts or people who might help speed things up

Thank you to anyone who read this. I’ve worked so hard to hold onto my education and I feel like I’m watching it slip away again. Please help in any way you can. Even the smallest reply helps.

During the interview process, no documents were requested apart from the passport, the questions asked and my answers were as follows: 

1) How long have you been in the UAE? 
About 22 years, since I was 4.

New York

1m74bvs,Feeling Stuck – Seeking Advice on Long-Term Visa Options,"Hi everyone,

I’m a Chinese passport holder currently living in Thailand on a student visa. I hold both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering, which I completed in Taiwan.

Unfortunately, due to the political situation between China and Taiwan, I wasn’t eligible to stay and work there after graduation, so I had to leave despite wanting to build a career aligned with my field.

For the past few years, I’ve been doing remote freelance work online. While it has kept me financially stable, the work doesn’t fully align with my academic background. I’ve been actively applying for roles in my field across different countries, but it has been very difficult to secure a position with visa sponsorship.

At this point, it feels like everything is stuck because of visa limitations, and I’m honestly feeling lost. I want to build a stable future and further my career, but I really don’t want to return to China to do that.

Are there any alternative pathways to obtain long-term visas (work, training, or other types) for someone in my situation? Has anyone been through a similar experience and found a way forward?

Any advice or suggestions would mean a lot.

1m737px,Taiwan Residant Visa for Studying,"Hello! I am currently in the process of applying for a resident visa to study in Taiwan. I plan on getting my Bachelor’s degree there. I am still currently waiting for admission results but I have already prepared some documents. I have one concern lang in applying for a resident visa. My sponsor is my grandfather so I will be using his bank statement. We requested for a bank statement last June 4, 2025 to submit to the school as part of the admission requirements. That time, the balance in his account was more than the required amount of NTD 120,000. However, the bank statement for resident visa application needs to be issued within 30 days. I will be applying in August this year so the bank statement I initially requested is no longer valid. My problem now is that since my grandfather is a contractual seafarer, he is currently on vacation and will resume employment this August as well, because of this, his bank balance has gone down to below the required amount because he withdrew funds for personal use. How can I present this to TECO Manila? Will they accept it if I submit a new bank statement which is below the required amount? I also plan on showing proof of his employment and that he will be working again this August. Pahelp po, thank you!

TL;DR: Applying for a Taiwan student visa. My sponsor is my grandfather, a contractual seafarer. His June 4 bank statement showed more than the NTD 120,000 required, but it’s now outdated. For my August visa application, I need a new bank statement issued within 30 days, but his balance has dropped below the required amount since he’s currently on vacation. He resumes work this August.

I am still currently waiting for admission results but I have already prepared some documents. I have one concern lang in applying for a resident visa. My sponsor is my grandfather so I will be using his bank statement. We requested for a bank statement last June 4, 2025 to submit to the school as part of the admission requirements. That time, the balance in his account was more than the required amount of NTD 120,000. However, the bank statement for resident visa application needs to be issued within 30 days. I will be applying in August this year so the bank statement I initially requested is no longer valid. My problem now is that since my grandfather is a contractual seafarer, he is currently on vacation and will resume employment this August as well, because of this, his bank balance has gone down to below the required amount because he withdrew funds for personal use. How can I present this to TECO Manila? Will they accept it if I submit a new bank statement which is below the required amount? I also plan on showing proof of his employment and that he will be working again this August. Pahelp po, thank you!

1m65f2k,"How is this legal, frustrating process.","This is just a vent. And hopefully someone can learn something from my mistakes! 
So my visa process starts in January of this year with me learning about the Cambodian background check for us citizens to get a Spain student visa for September. As you may be aware Cambodia is not a part of Hague Apostille Convention. Meaning I have to get the background check. Get it approved by the foreign affairs office in Cambodia and get it approved by the closest Spain consulate which is in Bangkok, Thailand. Lot more complicated then it sounds. I started that process in March of this year and just last week friday mid July got the paperwork. Two, I don't get back stateside untill June so I can't get my background started till then, thankfully that was easier than expected. Unfortunately I still had to get my background check apostalized by the state department so that got sent in ASAP. Got it back will last week mid - July.  Three, I have health issues. I had to find a student insurance that's not insanely expensive but still covers what I need to. Four,  What you'll learn in the paragraph is I don't make a lot of money so saving for this has been a big deal. 

Side note I was told by the consulate that I could mail my paperwork in. Yay. I'm a baker at a small company so I really can't get/ take time off work. But today reaching back out to get the address I get this email: saying I must go down to the San Francisco consulate to submit my paperwork. I live in Bellingham Washington. I really can't afford to get time off to try to get a appointment, for a visa I may or may not get because of my Cambodian background check and other various issues/ I'm special things. 

I have gotten all of my housing set up. Bought my tickets. Put my deposit down. Got accepted into the school which I thought was going to be the hardest part and a job offer while I'm in Spain. What the f*** is this process Spain.

1m5rl5v,"Confusion as to visa type, time restrictions and complications of international relationship.","Good evening all,

I'm a British national and have applied to the Nashville Teacher Residency, completed the first two rounds of interviews, and intend to attend next summer (starting July 2026). As such, I've deferred and had confirmation of approval *to* defer from the coordinators, but they haven't supplied me any additional tasks or requested any information yet (though I'm imagining that might be due to my deferral meaning I'm more on the back burner than students joining this academic year). Note: **I've not had confirmation of an offer to study yet.** 

Now, here's where things get complicated (in my mind):

The residency starts in 'Mid-July' - until I have a firm offer of study, I won't have a start date which makes obtaining the visa tricky in the first instance.

It's a 'residency' as opposed to a traditional university-based study programme. Does this change the visa requirement from an F1 to J1 as it is a vocational pursuit? And would this complicate the 'no-work' stipulation of typical student visas, as it is a work/study programme?

When I spoke to the coordinators, they did specify that they couldn't guarantee but imagine it might be likely for me to receive sponsorship for a work visa by the local education board, or an independent school, after my completion of the course.

A big reason for electing for this programme is that my partner, whom I met at university in the UK, is from Nashville - he moved back a couple of years ago due to issues outside our control, and I want to see things from a different perspective, having never lived out of the UK before. That and the residency model provides a dramatically different style of educator training to the conventional PGCSE route in the UK - and I am curious about the differences in Anglo-American educational practice. The residency is also paid where a PGCSE isn't - and graduation comes with a discount at a prestigious Tennessee university for further pursuit of education study.

He and I have spoken about the possibility of converting my visa to a fiance while I'm out there, or getting married at some point during my studies, but I'm scared of how this might complicate things, too. I don't want it to look like I'm in the US purely for the sake of a relationship - because I'm not - but at this point, both my relationship and my studies are very closely entangled. We've kept continuous evidence of our relationship anyway, just in case we do have to 'fall back' on that route.

I have strong ties to home with family and likely have an offer of a PCGE in my locality (I've two degrees and a lot of experience working in special needs education), so the 'return' requirement of the visa should be easy to complete.

1m4yi2m,San Fransisco Korean Embassy lost of Loss of Nationality Report,"I'm adopted from South Korea, and recently was given the opportunity to study abroad in South Korea by my community college. Well.. because I'm adopted I needed two extra documents when applying for my student visa: certificate of citizenship and loss of Nationality. After missing the spring semester to study abroad so I can focus on applying and retrieving the necessary documents, I was finally able to completely get them late May. 
However, I needed to drive (4 hours) to San Francisco to get my Loss of Nationality documents (?). Because of the distance, I called and texted hoping I could get it mailed to me instead. Over text my message was left on delivered and over call they could not understand my question.. So in mid June I drove out to San Francisco to get the documents only for the man behind the counter tell me he lost them. He was quick to reassure me, however, that I could still apply for my student visa because I had my certificate of citizenship.
Well, just two days ago I received a phone call from the SF Korean Embassy telling me that I need my loss of Nationality documents in order to receive approval. I tried my absolute hardest to explain to her my situation, and she looked up online for my documents (I'm quite unsure on this part, however, because all she asked was for my korean name and the month I made the application). In the end, she came up with nothing and basically kept reiterating herself on how I need my loss of Nationality paperwork.
The fall semester for the korean University I'm hoping to go to starts early August. This gives me only two and a half weeks to get my visa. I'm going to San Fransisco early tomorrow morning to hopefully explain my situation better in-person. I wasn't able to make a reservation, but I feel as though no reservation should be required.

I guess what I'm asking is: Is there a way for me to look up online my loss of Nationality report? If I reapplied for a copy of my loss of Nationality, would it come on time?

In the end, she came up with nothing and basically kept reiterating herself on how I need my loss of Nationality paperwork.
The fall semester for the korean University I'm hoping to go to starts early August. This gives me only two and a half weeks to get my visa. I'm going to San Fransisco early tomorrow morning to hopefully explain my situation better in-person. I wasn't able to make a reservation, but I feel as though no reservation should be required.

I guess what I'm asking is: Is there a way for me to look up online my loss of Nationality report? If I reapplied for a copy of my loss of Nationality, would it come on time? And how should I better explain my situation to the embassy?",san fransisco korean embassy lost loss nationality report adopted south korea recently given opportunity study abroad south korea community college well adopted needed two extra documents applying student visa certificate citizenship loss nationality missing spring semester study abroad focus applying retrieving necessary documents finally able completely get late may however needed drive hours san francisco get loss nationality documents distance called texted hoping could get mailed instead text message left delivered call could understand question mid june drove san francisco get documents man behind counter tell lost quick reassure however could still apply student visa certificate citizenship well two days ago received phone call korean embassy telling need loss nationality documents order receive approval tried absolute hardest explain situation looked online documents quite unsure part however asked korean name month made application end came nothing basically kept reiterating need loss nationality paperwork fall semester korean university hoping starts early august gives two half weeks get visa going san fransisco early tomorrow morning hopefully explain situation better inperson wasnt able make reservation feel though reservation required guess asking way look online loss nationality report reapplied copy loss nationality would come time better explain situation embassy,-1,misc,Other / General Immigration,Other / General Immigration,Visa Applications & Issues,sadness

1m3llax,Chilean visa for Indian Passport with a valid US visa,"I live in the US on H-1B on my Indian passport. Both visa and passport are valid for > 2 years from my intended date of entry into Chile. Their official government website has a PDF that says Indians need eVisa but exempted if holding a valid US visa (Except type C, which isn't what I have anyway).

Does this mean I just show up at the airport and they let me board a LATAM flight and once there, they check my valid passport with a valid US visa stamp and let me in or do I need a pre-authorization or some sort of pre-clearance?

I contacted Chilean embassy over email and they sent me a standard response which was basically the link the to PDF I found myself.

Website link: [https://www.consulado.gob.cl/cuadro-de-visas-y-aranceles-de-chile](https://www.consulado.gob.cl/cuadro-de-visas-y-aranceles-de-chile)

The PDF shows India with an appendix number 9 which in Spanish says

>Exento de visa de permanencia transitoria a nacionales de India portadores de una visa otorgada por EE.UU. (excepto la Visa C) con a lo menos 6 meses de vigencia o Green Card, a contar del 01.04.2019.

Google Translate

>Exemption from temporary stay visa requirements for Indian nationals holding a visa issued by the U.S. (except the C visa) with at least 6 months of validity or a Green Card, as of April 1, 2019.

Do I need to carry any documents on me to show the financial ability?

Apart from this, my first connection is by Delta and the app shows me to upload visa. But if I don't need a visa, will Delta let me board my first flight. Please note the flight operated by Delta is US domestic, then after is my LATAM flight which takes me to Santiago. Both airlines do basic check on my nationality and visa requirement but do not ask me anything about my US visa status to put me into exemption.

I also checked [https://www.iatatravelcentre.com](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com) which says

>**Visa Requirements**  
Nationals of India with a Permanent Resident/Resident Alien Card (Form I-551) issued by the USA do not need a visa for a maximum of 90 days.

But I do not have a US PR (aka greencard) or I-551 (not sure what that is). I just have H-1B and I-129 approval. This is what is having me confused.

I found a few posts with similar situation on reddit but none of the OPs responded with what they had to do.

1m03mql,does anyone have experience/knowledge on getting a uk visa via civil partnership?,"hello,

i’ve barely done research on this as i don’t really understand most of what i’m reading when i do, so i decided to ask on here. i want to move to the uk to my partner and i was originally planning to do so via a work visa and eventually settling, but after looking it seems the only option is by having a job that requires a university degree, which i don’t have as it’s not a “casual” thing in my country, and due to mental health issues i wouldn’t be able to handle even trying. i looked into other options and stumbled upon the option of getting a visa by being in a civil relationship with my partner. i know there is also an option by us getting married, but i dont want to get married just for a visa (i want us to get married when the time is right and all that).

so, how does it work? is it hard to get a visa approved by being in a civil partnership with someone from the uk? how does one even go about getting into a civil partnership? etc.

1lzpfjj,Irish Student Visa – Missing Pension Statement & New Loan Account (Need Advice),"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in the process of applying for an Irish student visa (Sept 2025 intake – MSc Finance at DCU), and I’m facing a couple of issues that I hope someone here might have some insight on.

My father is the main sponsor for my studies, and I’ve submitted the education loan sanction letter along with the statement showing loan disbursement. However, the amount was credited into a **newly opened account**, so it doesn’t have 6 months of history — which I now know is something they prefer to see.

The second issue is with my father's **pension account statement**.  
When I submitted my documents at **VFS Global**, I was informed that the pension statement would be required — but honestly, I wasn’t aware of this beforehand. I tried downloading it through the Union Bank portal right away, but couldn’t access it. Despite repeated attempts, I was unable to obtain the statement, so I submitted an explanation letter along with the rest of my documents.

Also, some of you may have seen a post I made earlier regarding a minor form-related issue and a verification call — won’t go into that again, but just for context, that situation also involved a call to my employer where not everything may have been clearly communicated.

So my questions are:

* Has anyone submitted a loan disbursed into a new account (under 6 months old) and still gotten approval?
* Has anyone missed a salary/pension account statement and explained it in writing — and been okay?
* If verification calls don’t go exactly right, does that always lead to problems?

Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through something similar. Thanks so much in advance 🙏",2025-07-14T15:28:18,slowwpeek,0,0,visas,https://www.reddit.com/r/visas/comments/1lzpfjj/irish_student_visa_missing_pension_statement_new/,['student visa'],"Irish Student Visa – Missing Pension Statement & New Loan Account (Need Advice) Hi everyone,

Every time I check, I get one of the following messages: •	“All available seats have been booked.” •	“All available dates have been reserved. Please make an appointment at a later date.” •	Or it just loops between those two messages endlessly.

1lsakv9,Lazy eye & French student visa photo (no glasses allowed) – anyone been in this situation?,"
Hi everyone,
I’m from Morocco and I’m applying for a visa long séjour étudiant for France.

I have a lazy eye (œil paresseux) that doesn’t show when I wear glasses — so I always wear them in daily life. But for the visa photo, TLScontact requires a clear photo with no glasses and no retouching.

In the past, photographers usually edited the eye slightly when I had to take photos without glasses. But this time, editing is not allowed, and I’m a bit anxious about how my eye will look in the photo.

I asked two opticians if contact lenses could help fix the appearance just for the picture, but they both said lenses don’t correct that kind of eye alignment.

Has anyone with a lazy eye (or similar issue) been accepted for a French visa even if their eye looked slightly off in the biometric photo?

Would really appreciate any advice or shared experience.

1loj27a,Do I need a transit visa for Frankfurt as a Filipino citizen with a UK visa?,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone here can clarify this for me.

I’m a Filipino citizen currently living in the UK with a valid UK visa (I have an eVisa and share code). I’ll be flying from Manchester to Manila this October 2025, and my flight has a 1 hour and 5 minute layover at Frankfurt Airport (Terminal 1). I won’t be leaving the international transit area.

On my return trip in November 2025, I’ll again transit through Frankfurt Airport (T1) with a 7 hour and 40 minute layover — still not planning to exit the airport.

Do I need a transit visa (Type A) for either of these layovers?

I’ve read that some nationals (including Filipinos) do need a visa unless certain conditions apply, but it’s a bit confusing when you already hold a valid UK visa.

Would appreciate any help or experience from others who’ve done this route!

Thanks in advance!

1leqdue,Argentina ETA / AVE visa for Indian with a valid US visa - H1B,"I'm planning to visit Argentina in August 2025. I'm an Indian citizen living in the US on a US H1B visa. I understand the process (https://www.migraciones.gov.ar/ave/pdf/procedimiento\_eeuu-20.pdf) is we need to pay the visa fees first (https://dnm.provincianet.com.ar) and then submit an application (https://www.dnm.gov.ar/avevisa/login) using the transaction id or payment receipt sticker generated in step 1.

However, on the AVE turista visa payment page I'm not seeing India in the nationality drop down list anymore. My guess is it is no longer required to pay visa fees for Indian citizens even for ETA. This  website (https://www.migraciones.gov.ar/ave/index.htm) is redirecting to a form which generates the sticker number without paying the visa fees for Indian citizens. With this sticker we can submit the application. I have submitted the application but not sure whether they will accept or reject and ask me to pay the fees.

1lby5d5,Japan Visa Bangalore VFS Experience,"My Experience Applying for a Japan Tourist Visa in Bangalore (June 2025)

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent experience applying for a Japan tourist visa at the VFS office in JP Nagar, Bangalore, as it might be helpful for others.

**A Quick Note on Jurisdiction:**

My passport was issued in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, which technically falls under the jurisdiction of the Kolkata embassy. However, my visa assistance agent advised that since I am currently working in Bangalore and have a local rental agreement, I was eligible to apply through the Bangalore VFS. This was a huge relief!

**Booking the Appointment:**

Booking the appointment was straightforward. I did it online through the official VFS Global website and found that dates were readily available. I secured a slot for June 12th, 2025.

**Documents I Submitted:**

I made sure to have all my documents in order as per the checklist. Here’s what I submitted:

Personal Documents:
* Original Passport (with at least 6 months validity)
* Two recent passport-size photographs (35x45mm, white background, matt finish, 80% face visible)
* Completed Visa Application Form
* Covering Letter explaining the purpose of my trip
* Detailed Travel Itinerary
* Flight and Hotel Bookings
* Personal ITRs for the last 3 years
* 6 months of personal bank statements, attested with a bank stamp and signature. (I just printed the e-statement and got it stamped at a local branch). I maintained a balance of over ₹1.5 lakh.
* My Bangalore Rental Agreement (as proof of residence)
* Photocopies of the front and back pages of my passport- this was discarded by visa officer

From my Employer:
* No Objection Certificate (NOC) stating the dates of my leave
* Company ID card copy - discarded by visa officer
* Last 3 months' salary slips

**The VFS Appointment Day (JP Nagar):**

I arrived at the VFS centre in JP Nagar about 30 minutes early. The ground floor was crowded with applicants for Schengen and UK visas. The first floor is designated for Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and a few other countries.

I was initially told to come back 15 minutes before my scheduled time. Once I went in, the process was quite smooth:

1.  Security & Token: After a quick security check, I was given a token.
2.  Document Submission: When my token number was called, I went to the counter. The officer reviewed all my documents.
3.  Payment: I was directed to the fee counter. Costed in total 1800 (including courier). 
Total User Pay service: 550
Total Visa Fees: 450
Total VFS Service Fees: 800
4.  Final Steps: I returned to the initial counter with the payment receipt. The officer took my application into a back room for a while. After he returned, I was asked to fill out the courier slip with my address and contact details.

The entire process inside the VFS center took about 50 minutes. The staff told me to expect a decision and the delivery of my passport within 5-7 working days.

**Tracking:**

I received a receipt with a tracking number. Unfortunately, as of now, I haven't been able to track the application online.

It's currently June 15th, so the waiting game begins! I'll be sure to post an update here once I receive my passport. Hope this helps anyone else going through the process!


Please Note: Don't bring any electronic items (except mobile obviously ) with you to VFS office. Just the documents.

2. Travel itinerary (From the place of stay to Japan)
3. Bank statements
4. Proof of legal presence in the US - F1 holders also need to submit their i20 along with the visa here

If you go on the website, it will let you know what jurisdiction your area falls under. Also when you are filling in your application, you will notice a place to upload multiple documents. If you have multiple files, combine all your pdf files into 1 big file and keep it at 2MB or less. They also told me that if I made a mistake on my application or they deemed my application to be insufficient, they would withdraw the application and I'd have to reapply with the changes which also resets the time for their review.

The website says it takes 2 weeks but mine took less than a week. Just have everything they want and it will be a smooth process. The fee, after you have been approved, is 832JPY. I attached a checklist given from their website below.

If you get accepted and travel there, follow the rules!! I am tired of other people nitpicking our people out there for no reason.

They also told me that if I made a mistake on my application or they deemed my application to be insufficient, they would withdraw the application and I'd have to reapply with the changes which also resets the time for their review.

The website says it takes 2 weeks but mine took less than a week. Just have everything they want and it will be a smooth process. The fee, after you have been approved, is 832JPY. I attached a checklist given from their website below.

If you get accepted and travel there, follow the rules!! I am tired of other people nitpicking our people out there for no reason.

1l6rg4n,Planning to apply for F-1 Visa After J-2 With 2-Year Rule – Need Advice,"Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice or insight on my situation.

I’m currently in the U.S. on a J-2 visa as a dependent of a J-1 visa holder. I plan to return to my home country in about a month, and I would like to apply for an F-1 student visa after I return.

However, there’s a complication — my current visa is subject to the two-year home residency requirement (212(e)), and I’m worried that this might affect my chances of getting approved for an F-1 visa.

I’m not planning to change my status while in the U.S. — I will be applying for the F-1 visa directly from my home country, after I leave. I understand that the 212(e) rule mainly prevents people from adjusting their status inside the U.S. or applying for certain visas (like H-1B or a green card) before fulfilling the requirement or obtaining a waiver. But I’m still unsure if this rule could negatively impact my chances when applying for a student visa from abroad.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has professional experience with this, I’d be very grateful for your input.",2025-06-09T00:36:18,art_mask,1,1,visas,https://www.reddit.com/r/visas/comments/1l6rg4n/planning_to_apply_for_f1_visa_after_j2_with_2year/,['student visa'],"Planning to apply for F-1 Visa After J-2 With 2-Year Rule – Need Advice Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice or insight on my situation.

1l6jfnp,India - Bangladesh (and back),"In India right now on a 1y multi entry tourist visa, EU passport holder. Will go to Nepal soon, stay a few weeks then back to India. Then the plan is to go to bangladesh via one of the land borders where visa on arrival is possible. Stay and be completely amazed by the country.
Eventually return to India yet again using land borders.

Questions:

1. Will l be asked to show any proof of leaving Bangladesh upon entering? (Really hope that they wont as only  flights can be booked well in advance and not planning on doing that)

2. My 1y multi entry visa has been obtained as an evisa, in the passport l only got stamps, not a full page sticker. Could that be a problem when reentering India? Which land entry point would be the smoothest if any?

3. Will this visit to Bangladesh disqualify me from obtaining another Indian visa in the future? When filling in the form, one must list all the countries visited in the past 10 years. Knowing that the history is not all rosy between the two, it is giving me a slight worry that I will be limited for a while... 

4. In case Bangladesh is beyond all expectations and im feeling like extending my stay, how does the process look like?
Asking here as in developing Asia, so many times official statements don't fully represent available options in reality.

All answers are most appreciated. Cheering to hear from people who had done the same. Also if you are planning to do something similar im super willing to share my experience. Shoutout to fellow CS members! ♡

Ive been with my now wife (28f from the Philippines) have been together for roughly 5 years in a serious and committed loving relationship, we got married 6 months ago in canada where she is currently residing on a student visa. We are trying to figure out how to bring her to California with me. I like a gool quit my job 6 months ago. And just got a new one last week. I start this week. We're both really terrible with beaurocracy and paperwork, I feel incredibly stupid and lost when trying to do her paperwork. Im afraid im going to make a mistake, and im concerned about my lapse in work being an issue. I don't have a savings, I don't have any family willing to help or sign anything to help take financial responsibility even just on paper. My roommate offered but idk if that works. Frankly I feel lost and scared. I don't want to lose her and I know she doesn't want to lose me. We're both very tired and frustrated.

Id gladly move up there to her if there was any easier way to do that. I genuinely don't know what to do and im just hoping someone can help steer us in the right direction.

1ky8q3d,Germany Schengen Visa Rejected (Article 10) – Should I reapply from Germany again?,"Hi everyone,
I recently applied for a business Schengen visa through Germany and unfortunately got rejected under Article 10. I’m trying to figure out what went wrong and how I should approach my next application.


	•	I already hold a valid Germany visa (still active for 15 more days), and I plan to fly there in 2 days.
	•	I’ve been to Germany before (via a family visit visa) and returned on time.
	•	This time I applied with a business invitation from my relative’s company (hospitality industry).
	•	Since the original QR-coded invitation was delayed, my visa agent reused the same invitation sent to my father and brother, only modifying the name and passport details. I now understand this may have triggered the rejection.
	•	Ironically, my father and brother received 5-year business visas with the exact same invitation.
	•	I also hold a valid UK visa and have a clean travel history.

Now I’m worried about:
	•	Does this count as document fraud, even if the company is real and just the invite was prematurely altered?
	•	Will I face problems at the German border in 2 days, even though I have a valid visa?
	•	Could this affect future Schengen applications, even from other countries?

My plan:
	•	I’m planning to request a new, official invitation (directly in my name), and reapply in ~2 months.
	•	But I’m unsure whether I should apply from Germany again, or switch to another Schengen country like Italy or France.

My questions:
	1.	Should I reapply through Germany again, or is another country safer at this point?
	2.	If I go through Germany again, how should I explain this situation in the cover letter (without sounding like I committed fraud)?

Any advice or insights from similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

1m9cn4s,"British citizenship timing dilemma — trying to meet both 5-year presence and 12-month settled status, but 3 days short","Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate your insights on a British citizenship timing issue.  
I'm currently facing a dilemma between two core requirements that almost—but not quite—align.

# 📌 My situation:

* First arrival in the UK for long-term residence: **12 September 2019**
* **Left the UK: 28 July 2020** due to COVID-related disruption and the shift to online education
* **Returned: 9 January 2021**
* Have been continuously resident in the UK since
* **Settled status granted: 31 July 2024**

# 🇬🇧 Citizenship requirements I’m navigating:

1. Be **physically present in the UK exactly 5 years before the application date**
2. Have held **settled status for at least 12 months at the time of application**
3. Not have spent more than **450 days outside the UK in the last 5 years**
4. Not have spent more than **90 days outside the UK in the last 12 months**

# ✅ What I meet:

* I plan to apply on **27 July 2025**, and I was **physically present in the UK on 27 July 2020** → ✅ So I meet the **5-year physical presence requirement**
* My **total absences in the last 5 years** = \~**258 days**
* My **absences in the last 12 months** = well under 90 days → ✅ So I meet the **residency and absence conditions**

# ⚠️ What I don’t quite meet:

* My **settled status was granted on 31 July 2024**
* Applying on **27 July 2025** means I fall exactly **3 days short** of the required 12-month period

So:

* If I apply before 28 July → I meet the presence rule, but not the 12-month settled rule
* If I wait for 31 July → I meet the settled rule, but miss the presence requirement (since I left the UK on 28 July 2020)

# 😷 COVID-related absence (28 July 2020 – 9 Jan 2021, 165 days):

* This absence lasted **165 days**, so it’s **under the 180-day threshold**
* My university **verbally advised** international students to return home during a Teams meeting (no written record)
* My **student accommodation** also asked us to vacate rooms
* My PhD supervisor **informally advised** me to remain overseas until January 2021
* I returned to the UK on **9 January 2021** and have been living here ever since

🟡 I’m also hoping this long absence won’t be considered a break in **continuous residence**, given that it was COVID-related and under 180 days — but I’d appreciate any confirmation or experience from others.

# 🙏 Why I’m posting:

I may not be in the UK in early 2026, so waiting until January to apply could become practically impossible.  
I really don’t want to lose my chance to apply for citizenship **just because of a 3-day technicality**, especially when I meet all other requirements.  
I’m wondering whether discretion might apply in this case, considering the COVID-related absence and how close the dates are.

# ❓My questions:

* Has anyone successfully applied slightly before completing the 12-month settled status period?
* Would a **cover letter** explaining the COVID-related absence and timing conflict help?
* Has anyone faced a similar issue with **continuous residence** during COVID-related absences?
* Or is this simply too risky, and should I wait?

1maj38t,(England) EU citizen passed away - What to do?,"Hi, I’m looking for some advice on how to proceed with this situation..

My best friend of 27 years passed away on Tuesday. He lived in England and had settled status. The coroner is currently investigating the cause, so it will be approx. 2 weeks before they release the body and death certificate. His family (mum and brother) lives in the EU and don’t speak English. They asked me if I could deal with everything here as I live in England, too - collecting his stuff from the police/house, collecting death certificate, deal with cremation and transport to home country. They want to write a letter with a copy of their ID’s to give me permission to collect the body, order cremation, transport his ashes, cancel his bank account etc. I read gov’s website about what steps must be taken in case of someone’s death. There is no will and the most valuable item is probably a laptop. We don’t know how much money he’s got in the bank, but I’m almost 100% sure that all his belongings + money have value less than £36,000 (small estate limit).

My question is - Is such a letter enough, so I can legally deal with all steps of this process? Do I need to involve a solicitor/court to get this permission officially?

Just a note: the police called me several times to inform me about next steps etc and they said that because of this unique situation (his family being in different country and not speaking English), they can share details with me.

Not sure if it’s relevant, but I’m EU citizen with settled status as well.

- Keep contributions genuinely voluntary (no fixed hours, no formal tasks).
- Each student signs an IP-assignment deed today.
- The company signs an option deed held in escrow and it only becomes effective when the student has a visa that permits business activity or self-employment.

Hi all,


First of all, I'm so happy to find this forum! The Guardian was great in publishing these 2 articles.
I don't know where to start. I hope I wont be too long. But I feel I need to speak up.
I don't need any immigration law information, and I am well aware that this forum is not designed for this. I just hope to find the right emotional support as we stand better together.


I am a French national. I came here in September 2007 straight after finishing my studies in France. I was just a 21 year old au pair. But like some of us, I decided to stay as I just fell in love with the country and the multiculturalism. I thought that we would have a better chance here in the UK as my partner was African. At the time, he was living in the Ivory Coast (a French speaking African country).

Im not going to explain everything in details but we basically sorted everything paperwork wise by getting married in his country. I dealt with the Ivorian, the French, the EU and the UK laws. Each with their own drawbacks. The Ivorian in which every little bribes made things easier, the French one with its high bureaucracy and plain racism in the French consulate in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and I even had a personal menace at some point through private messages, from a staff in the French consulate in London! The British High Commission was really efficient in Ghana from where my husband travelled to the UK. And the EU law puts everything together by allowing us the right to live together as a family. It made the UK visa application possible by having it free. So my husband came here under a family permit, which lasted a few months. He then got granted a 5 year “family member of an EEA national residency card” (a specific type of visas for family members of EEA nationals), which once again was free of charge.

5 years after, we then had to start the next process: asking a permanent residency card. The same one we are talking about.
This application is actually mainly designed for non EEA nationals who are a family member of EEA nationals. So any spouse of an EEA national: it could be a Vietnamese with a French, a Moroccan with a Spanish, etc, etc. for us, it’s an Ivorian with a French. Whatever… At this time, we were separated but still married, and had 2 children.

So we applied for this permanent residency card in January 2016. It was a reasonable amount of £65 (thanks to the EU laws). We spent days and days dealing with the application, around Christmas last year. At the end, we didn’t have a big envelope to send, but a huge parcel of documents.

They said it would take them about 6 months to reply. They did it within 6 months. Actually, they wrote the letter the day of the result of the referendum. Now that is my opinion. Many people told me it was just pure coincidence. But for me it wasn’t. I have been stabbed in the chest by the government. It is how I felt. 

So here is their answer: my ex-partner father of our 2 daughters, had been asked to leave the country because… the Home Office denied my permanent right of residency. I have been here nearly 10 years. Newspapers that said that you are automatically granted permanent residency after 5 years is not true. As many of you have seen in this form, to have the right of residency, you need to prove that you were either a worker, self-employed, self-sufficient or full time student for 5 consecutive years. I proved everything during a 5 year period: 1 job, 1 maternity leave paid by my company, then another job and maternity leave paid by the government, as I didn’t have enough hours at my second job to be able to get Statutory Maternity Pay. So my first maternity leave was accepted as I was still a worker, as the company paid me. But after that they though that I didn’t earn enough as my P60 showed that I didn’t earn enough. They didn’t bother (point made by our lawyer) looking at all the documents: they simply said I didn’t earn enough, therefore my job was not seen as ""genuine and effective"", but ""marginal and supplementary"". So the appeal is all about that: is a job marginal and supplementary when at the time I started, I was the only bread winner (my husband lost his job then) ? and then I went on maternity leave, however paid by the government. I was still an employee at the company. The EU laws also stated that there was no minimum hours required to be considered a worker. However, you just needed to show that your job is ""genuine and effective"".
I am sorry to be a bit long, but here is the point I want to explain to people: the Home Office can turn the EU immigration laws as they wish. There is the Law and then, there is the interpretation of it all. They can just turn it around as they want. My story is real. I haven’t lied anything. The father of my children is facing deportation (they also kept his passport) because his rights as a family member depends on my rights as an EEA national. By denying my permanent right to reside, they consequently say that my ex partner has no more right to stay in the UK.

This letter was written on the 24 of June 2016. We received it at the end of June. Although they mentioned the fact that we could appeal, there was no sign of a deadline in the letter. I had to dig the info online. When we managed to get an interview with an immigration lawyer, just a few days later, we calculated that the deadline was the day after the appointment! It is how they are. They send their decision letter second post and don’t give you any clues about your appeal’s rights. However, the grounds of appeal have been sent a few months ago now. So far, we haven’t had any news from the immigration tribunal yet. At first, I hoped they would take some time, as it allows us to save the £3000 needed for having a lawyer with us. Now I wish the tribunal could speed up a bit. I don’t want this to take years, to find out that these EU regulations we are fighting for will be scrapped by the Brexit decisions.
As I said, I felt I have been stabbed by the government and I am talking with some immigration paperwork background behind me. At first I was in denial, and just angry, and could just manage to grab a few documents here and there needed for the appeal. That was in July. But now, I can see the file I have made, just under a pile of bills, and I can’t touch it anymore. Looking at it, makes me cry or want to scream. I am in a total blockage over this. Our lawyer asks us so many other things, but although we have most of it, I just can’t sit down and work on it. I am still in shock, months later. I have been hurt so badly by this decision I can’t really explain completely. I know I would have to sit down and do it at some point, but at the moment, I just can’t. And I am a person applying to study at uni for a midwifery degree. Nobody could deny my rights to have a family, my rights to have a pregnancy and a paid maternity leave. I can’t understand their decision. It is just beyond my understanding, especially the impact it has on my family.
I am sorry it is not a short text. But I really need people to understand my situation. I don’t need any immigration law information. I am just here to say my story, and explain that nobody is safe. Nobody can plainly assume that they could have their permanent right of residency, especially because on the other hand, the HMRC granted my 5 year right of residency. So in fact, they disagree between themselves. But the Home Office is above the HMRC, no matter what.

I contacted the Royal College of Midwives, because their CEO, Cathy Warwick, has always been clear on the importance of EU nationals working in the NHS and defend the right of all EU nationals settled in the UK to stay here. So I wrote a personal letter to her, to thank her and explain my situation. She thanked me personally with a long personal letter too. She also said that it is because/thanks to people like me that she will always speak up for EU nationals rights to work and live here. I was grateful for it. Now I will certainly thank The Guardian, something I wanted to do for a while. It is the only paper who mentioned that living in the UK for 5 years is not enough for permanent right residency.

Im in limbo. I can’t really open another case and ask my own permanent residency certificate (it is a certificate for EEA members, but a card-visa styled document attached to the passport for a non EEA national). Even though, the case is on my partner’s name, the arguments are about me…


I wish people all the luck and courage and apply for their permanent right of residency certificate. I’m just drained at the moment.
I don’t want to cause fear to people. Just to share my personal experience about it all.
Thank you very much for reading me. I am more than grateful for your support.
Lets help each other in this situation.

56wzrb,Permanent Residency,"# What the Permanent Residency is about ?

> You automatically have permanent residence status (sometimes called the ‘permanent right to reside’) if you’ve lived in the UK for 5 years as a **‘qualified person’**.

> You get permanent residence in less than 5 years in certain situations ([details on getting the permanent residence earlier](https://www.gov.uk/eea-registration-certificate/getting-permanent-residence-early)) - for example, if you have to stop working or you retire early. 

> You’re usually a qualified person if you’re a citizen of a European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland and you’re one of the following:

> * working
> * studying
> * self-employed
> * self-sufficient
> * looking for work

> However you **must** provide proof that you’re qualified. 

> **You can apply for a permanent residence card if you have lived in the UK for a continuous period of 5 years as a 'qualified person'.**

> The application can be downloaded here : [https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/eea-pr](https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/eea-pr)

> The cost of this application is £65.

> ------------------------------------------

> ## Applicants who are in the UK in breach of immigration laws

>> *It might be the case of EU citizen if we actually leave the EU and lose the freedom of movement.*

> > **Please be aware that making this application does not automatically entitle you to remain in the UK while your application is being considered.** If you are a person who requires, but no longer has, leave to enter or remain in the UK and the Home Office is satisfied you do not qualify for a residence card or any other form of leave, you may be liable to be removed.

> > If you are detained for immigration purposes, you must immediately inform the Home Office and your detention centre that you have submitted an EEA application.

> **If you’re applying as an unmarried partner**

> If you’re applying as the unmarried (durable) partner of an EEA national, you must show that you have been living together in a relationship similar to a marriage or civil partnership since you were last issued with a registration certificate or residence card in this category.

> We recommend that you send at least 2 or 3 items addressed to you and your partner jointly for each year you have been living together (or each year since you were last issued with a registration certificate or residence card, if applicable). If you have changed address during this period, the evidence should cover each address you have
lived at. The evidence should come from a variety of sources.

> > For example, to cover a 5-year period living at the same address, you should send a minimum of
10-15 items, from 4 or 5 different sources, addressed to you jointly, spread evenly throughout the
5 years. 

> If you do not have enough items in your joint names, you may also provide items addressed to each of you individually if they show the same address for both of you.

> You automatically have permanent residence status (sometimes called the ‘permanent right to reside’) if you’ve lived in the UK for 5 years as a **‘qualified person’**.

> You get permanent residence in less than 5 years in certain situations ([details on getting the permanent residence earlier](https://www.gov.uk/eea-registration-certificate/getting-permanent-residence-early)) - for example, if you have to stop working or you retire early. 

> You’re usually a qualified person if you’re a citizen of a European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland and you’re one of the following:

> * working
> * studying
> * self-employed
> * self-sufficient
> * looking for work

> However you **must** provide proof that you’re qualified. 

> **You can apply for a permanent residence card if you have lived in the UK for a continuous period of 5 years as a 'qualified person'.**

> The application can be downloaded here : [https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/eea-pr](https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/eea-pr)

> The cost of this application is £65.

> ------------------------------------------

> ## Applicants who are in the UK in breach of immigration laws

>> *It might be the case of EU citizen if we actually leave the EU and lose the freedom of movement.*

> > **Please be aware that making this application does not automatically entitle you to remain in the UK while your application is being considered.** If you are a person who requires, but no longer has, leave to enter or remain in the UK and the Home Office is satisfied you do not qualify for a residence card or any other form of leave, you may be liable to be removed.

> > If you are detained for immigration purposes, you must immediately inform the Home Office and your detention centre that you have submitted an EEA application.

------------------------------------------

> * Two passport-sized photographs of you (the main applicant) with your name written on the back.

> > **If applicable**

> > * Two passport-sized photographs of **each family member** applying with you with their names written on the back.
> > * One passport-sized photograph of **your sponsor** (named in section 2) with their name written on the back.

> All photographs must conform to the standards set out in the separate [photograph guidance](https://www.gov.uk/photos-for-passports).

> ------------------------------------------

> **If you’re applying as an unmarried partner**

> If you’re applying as the unmarried (durable) partner of an EEA national, you must show that you have been living together in a relationship similar to a marriage or civil partnership since you were last issued with a registration certificate or residence card in this category.

> We recommend that you send at least 2 or 3 items addressed to you and your partner jointly for each year you have been living together (or each year since you were last issued with a registration certificate or residence card, if applicable). If you have changed address during this period, the evidence should cover each address you have
lived at. The evidence should come from a variety of sources.

> > For example, to cover a 5-year period living at the same address, you should send a minimum of
10-15 items, from 4 or 5 different sources, addressed to you jointly, spread evenly throughout the
5 years. 

> If you do not have enough items in your joint names, you may also provide items addressed to each of you individually if they show the same address for both of you.

1jr76om,Write to your MP: Allow physical proof of immigration status,"The eVisa scheme has proved chaotic. But there's a simple solution to this mess: allow physical proof of immigration status. 

The eVisa replaces physical documents with online proof of immigration status. But technical and adminstrative problems mean that many people can't create or access the eVisa when they need it. 

Travellers stranded at airports, refugees unable to rent a home or get a job, and a man being made homeless – these are some of the horror stories we have heard since the Home Office’s eVisa scheme came into effect.

1fjptwz,Broken e-Visa scheme could lead to digital Windrush scandal,"🚨 e-Visas = the making of a digital Windrush scandal.

Our report finds that this digital-only and online-only proof of status will expose millions of migrants to error-prone systems. Without physical or saved digital documentation, migrants will be exposed to data errors, system crashes and Internet outages. People could be unable to prove their right to be in the UK.

Migrants' proof of status will be checked in real-time. Using algorithmic guesswork, application records will be live matched and rematched across multiple databases. It carries the risk of potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of errors. Errors that can have life-changing consequences.

This fragile system of real-time checking was used for the EU Settlement Scheme. Reports collected by the3million show cases of mismatched records, out-of-date decisions and technical glitches preventing access.

In March, the government admitted that their new casework database, Atlas, had mismatched people's identities in 70,000 records. With 4 million people needing e-Visas, even a small error rate creates a vast number of people wrongly denied access to work, services or unable to enter the UK.

The switch to e-Visas at the end of 2024 creates a system where a person's right to be in the UK can glitch out, or get turned off by the Home Office in real-time as soon as it thinks there might be a reason to do so. It's a digital Windrush scandal in the making.

1fea0rd,The e-Visa scheme could create another Windrush scandal ,"By the end of 2024, proof of the right to be in the UK will be fully digitalised. Up to 4 million migrants will be at risk of not being able to prove their status offline.

🔴 Many people don't know that they need to apply for an e-Visa, due to emails being sent to the wrong people and the lack of an awareness campaign.

🔴 To register for an e-Visa, you need a smartphone that can make contactless transactions. Many migrants, especially older people, don't have these devices or lack the necessary technical literacy.

🔴 The previous EU Settlement Scheme shows that digital systems are susceptible to incorrect data, crashes and Internet outages. Without physical documentation, people could be denied entry to the UK, access to services and funding.

People with the right to be in the UK may not be able to prove their status due to flaws in the scheme’s rollout and implementation.

1m2dk7b,Why I believe Farage and Reform can't be trusted for the working class,"Every day I see more and more reasons to not like Farage. I don’t get why he/Reform are popular among some circles besides for the bombastic rhetoric, but that doesn’t count for anything once you start analysing things.

Firstly, Reform apparently wants to leave the ECHR because of “criminals”. But after the last Tory government, it’s only shown me how important it is to have guardrails against a government that thinks it is invincible. I’d rather keep my human rights via the ECHR than surrender them to Farage, a man who only cares about advancing his political career.

Secondly, I’ve learned that Reform is pretty against remote working. This is the LAST thing a politician should be mad about. The majority of hybrid/remote workers show happiness with their arrangements. Flexible working cuts commuting costs, saves time sitting like a zombie in rush hour traffic, and gives people location flexibility. So, if Farage wants to be a man of the working people, why does he push against measures that the working people say are positive for them?! Hm...

Thirdly, Farage and Reform are obsessed with climate change denial. Reform-led Durham county council voted to scrap the climate emergency warning dating from 2019, which is clownery when we’ve just experienced a drought and heatwave. Climate change is real, and it's here.

Farage also paints all migrants on benefits as “charity users”, and published a piece in the Daily Mail calling for an end to benefits for foreign nationals. This is illegal and unworkable in the real world, particularly for EU settled status holders (EU nationals who’ve lived here since before 2021), who have recognised rights to access public services + funds.

Lastly, Reform has also proposed to cut benefits for all job-seekers beyond 4 months. This is so ludicrously unrealistic it's not even funny. It will send countless people into quick financial distress whilst not giving them a long-term tailored pathway into the workforce. What will happen to all the jobs programmes to help the disadvantaged? If Reform wants to cut unemployment, they need to implement structural change that will deliver more jobs. Otherwise, they're just punishing the poor, and I don't respect that.

And also, the whole trickery behind saying our country is declining because we just “didn't do Brexit hard enough” and “we need Reform to make Brexit work”. It's so disingenuous and I don't respect that either. It's not like we have one of the worst inequality statistics in the rich world or anything.",2025-07-17T17:22:44,coffeewalnut08,26,155,ukpolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1m2dk7b/why_i_believe_farage_and_reform_cant_be_trusted/,['settled status'],"Why I believe Farage and Reform can't be trusted for the working class Every day I see more and more reasons to not like Farage.

r1cfgd,California's PC1000 programme and the ESTA questions,"I am a British Citizen, I’d like to visit the US again and my job may require me to travel there for work in the future. While on a J1 student visa I was arrested and completed California’s Penal Code 1000 pretrial diversion programme to avoid conviction for possession of a controlled substance. When I was arrested, my fingerprints were taken.

The PC1000 programme specifically states I am allowed to claim I have never been arrested and/or convicted, so can I complete the ESTA question **3. Have you ever violated any law related to possessing, using, or distributing illegal drugs?** and say **NO**, because the PC1000 enables me too?

The specific wording from [here](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/penal-code/1000/#5.1) is - *“The defendant may then truthfully indicate in response to any question concerning his or her prior criminal record that he or she was not arrested or granted pretrial diversion for the offense.” The one exception is an application for law enforcement.*

My arrest records were sealed, but I guess immigration can access those if they really want?

I’m worried that as PC1000 is a state-level programme it would not cover the ESTA, a federal thing. Maybe they would approve my ESTA but then at the borders, my fingerprints would flag and they’d open my sealed record and be like “you lied”.

Is my only/the best option the Hranka waiver?

geddsq,Student Visa question,"I am currently on a TD visa which allows me to study my master, however, next summer I am thinking on getting an internship and for that, I would need an F1/OPT. 

The language in USCIS states: *""You do not need to have had F-1 status for the one full academic year; you can satisfy the “one full academic year” requirement even if you had another nonimmigrant status during that time*.""  My question is, do someone knows if I can stay both semesters on my TD visa and once the internship's time gets closer, apply for the F1/OPT at the same time? It would be around 7 months before I graduate.

ej7x5f,Apply for a U.S Tourist Visa,"Hey Reddit,

I was seeking some advice on how to proceed with applying for a US tourist visa for my mom. As a family we had previously overstayed in US(dad had his reasons) but we were deported. My mom was a housewife and generally just followed as the events played out. I’m currently in US and want her to attend my masters graduation ceremony. However she was not given a VISA previously two times for my undergraduate ceremony on the basis of overstaying. It was over 15 years ago that we had overstayed. I had no problems acquiring a student visa as I was under 18 but unfortunately it looks like even though the “ban” is up she still can’t get a tourist visa. Is there anything we can do other than keep trying to get her a tourist visa? Is there a ban waiver process that we need to look into? We did not get deported on the basis of any crime or anything, just normally overstayed.

9aekhb,Will a denied tourist visa lower chances for student visa in the future?,"As the title says, if someone applies to the US for a tourist visa and for some reason it is denied; and then this person subsequently applies for a student visa as part their post graduate education will the denied tourist visa have any substantial negative affect on getting the student visa approved?

Basically, I have a friend who is interested in immigrating to the US through school but would like to come visit first before making the commitment to apply to schools in the US. It seems logical to me that this should be allowed but she’s coming from Iran which has all sorts of immigration obstacles and as such could get denied. 

Would this attempt at a tourist visa hurt her chances to apply later? She has European and Canadian tourist visas already.

971dhp,"Marrying non-US citizen - legal issues, concerns, pitfalls? (x-post from r/immigration)","I have been dating a girl from another country for almost exactly two years now and we have been living together for roughly the same amount of time. She is currently here on a student visa. Her visa will run out in about six more months. She has been applying for jobs for a year and finally landed a short term job in her field, however they have told her that, while they would like to hire her permanently, even if they were willing to go through the sponsorship process for her, it would take more than a year to get her sponsored, based on their experience with another of their employees.

While I genuinely love my girlfriend in the deepest sense of the word, I do not truly feel like I am at the point of being ready to marry her as I’ve always felt that I would need to be with someone for several years before feeling comfortable enough to marry them. However I do not want her to be forced to leave when her visa expires, so I have been strongly considering marrying her so we can remain together in the United States.

I’ve already done the research regarding prenuptial agreements and the mechanics of her applying for citizenship in the US once we have married. My question is, are there any legal pitfalls I am unknowingly opening myself up to? For instance, I read something recently that a US citizen who marries a non-citizen who later gains US citizenship is required to take care of the new citizen for five years from the date of marriage, regardless of whether or not they divorce in that time period. I haven’t been able to find any additional info to confirm or deny this. I obvious do not expect that we would be getting divorced, but I also know that we are both humans and humans change, etc. I have seen plenty of seemingly excellent relationships crumble during my short time on this earth, so I am aware that just because something is a certain way presently does not mean that it will be that way in perpetuity.

So, again, I am looking for advice on any problems/issues/concerns to look out for or be aware of. Imagine I am your son and I have just called you to get your motherly/fatherly advice based on the information above.

EDIT: Also, any suggestions regarding alternate (legal) ways to accomplish the goal of my girlfriend continuing to stay in the US are certainly welcome!",2018-08-13T19:32:30,InLoveNeedAdvice1111,1,3,immigrationlaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigrationlaw/comments/971dhp/marrying_nonus_citizen_legal_issues_concerns/,['student visa'],"Marrying non-US citizen - legal issues, concerns, pitfalls?

8evgi1,"I plan to travel to Iran this summer, but I worry I might not be able to re-enter the US to complete my degree. What are my rights as an F-1 visa holder?","Hello everyone,

I've been searching everywhere but I can't find a satisfying answer that would tell me whether or not I should make this trip.

I just started a PhD degree in the US. I'm a Canadian citizen with an F-1 student visa, and my partner is from Iran. I have the visa for entry to Iran ready to go meet their family there, but I can't tell whether it's too risky to go right now. I know that no non-US citizens can expect uninterrupted travel across US borders right now, but things with Iran specifically are making me worried that I might be prevented from coming back to continue my degree, even after I apply for the post-Iran trip visa that's required for anyone.

Does anyone have any insight on this? What are my rights here, as a non-citizen? Would I merely miss a flight back in, or would they stop me entirely? If they can indeed stop me from coming back into the US on my visa for all time, what percent chance is there that that would actually happen?

I know that everything's up in the air with such a xenophobic administration, but it's really important that I both make this trip and continue my studies. Any help is greatly appreciated.
