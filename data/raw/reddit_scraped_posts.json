    "selftext": "I apologize as this post is not directly related to UK Visa, but I did want to put a warning out there.\n\nFolks here have been very helpful, and I'm unsure if any of those here actually also work or have connections with the GRO.  Many of us applying may request documents from the GRO, so I thought this was germane to the sub.  If not, I would appreciate somewhere else I might contact as I doubt just emailing the GRO at their main number will do anything.\n\nI requested some documents from the GRO in March.  I used a credit card (I'm US based with a US credit card) which I almost never use.  In fact it hadn't been used all year (including up until now) with the exception of this one transaction.  The reason I used it is it because it has 0% foreign transaction fee.\n\nWell, I just got a fraud alert from my bank for a $29 transaction for EPA DU MUSEE DU LOVRE.\n\nThis sounds like it is for the Louvre Museum in Paris.\n\nI just found it incredibly coincidental that a card that was used only once all year in the UK happens to have a fradulent charge just next door.  I have had fraudulent charges before on various cards over the past 10 years, but all have been US based.\n\nMaybe it's nothing but coincidence.  Maybe the GRO has been hacked.  Maybe it is one lone employee taking numbers out of the system?  Maybe it's nothing, but I just wanted to put it out there.  ",

He is a foreign national. Our wedding reception is abroad in December 2025. We are unsure of the best course of action to take regarding the visa situation. We currently have the following 2 options for the spouse visa:\n\n1 - Do our religious marriage + wedding ceremony abroad together in December, and obtain the relevant documents to verify this is a genuine, registered marriage from the UAE. (Not quite sure how to do this at the moment)\n\n2- Apply for a fianc\u00e9 visa and do the civil and religious marriage in the UK within the months before December. This will then be used for the spouse visa application. \n\nI have concerns about option 1; can this certificate that I obtain from the UAE be used as a valid marriage certificate for the spouse visa? Does anyone know what steps are required to verify/validate this, if any? \n\nIf we apply for the fianc\u00e9 visa, can my fianc\u00e9 enter the UK on his standard visitor's visa in the meantime? \n\nIf then switching the fianc\u00e9 visa to a spousal visa, how long does the process take for approval? \n\nAny assistance or help would be highly appreciated!!",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI've been combing through this thread looking for immigration attorneys and seen many people say to ask this group before contacting one, so here goes. I'm going to give as much info as possible, while staying vague for privacy. \n\nI've been in the UK since 2016, and am looking at 10 years via long residency next autumn. I've been on a tier 4, tier 2, tier 4 again, graduate, and finally unmarried partner visa. It's been a journey. I thought that I was finally in the home stretch, but things have gone massively downhill with my partner and they have made it clear they are not interested in renewing the visa (leaving me with a 6 month gap before ILR) and they want out. This has been heartbreaking and terrifying with the new changes to the rules. I work as a freelancer in an artistic field, and had thought if it came to this I would take a break from my freelance work to go and try to get a similarly skilled Tier 2 job like I held in the past (covid happened). The recent changes mean all the jobs i am qualified for have been removed from the list, apart from one on the temporary shortage list but it is a huge long shot as it again is a role that is predominantly freelance. \n\nAs far as I am aware, and through much research,  my understanding is that my industry (at my level) is not eligible for global talent. As I am on a partner visa pursuing another relationship would be unrealistic. My understanding is that self sponsorship through setting up a limited company would also be challenging as you need another person within said company to oversee the visa, on top of proof of funds. I am considering applying for further education as the absolute last resort due to the huge expense (and hoping that I can easily apply for ILR at the end of it without having to repeat this stress in a year, as student visa to ILR is a bit unclear in my reading). All of this said, I am so close to the end of this road I don't want to lose everything now. I feel like I've considered every possible avenue, and am hoping someone will think of something I haven't. \n\nOtherwise, if anyone can recommend a solicitor who will do consultations (rather than the whole deal upfront) just so I can drill into this with specific questions and make sure I really have exhausted the list I would hugely appreciate it. Hugs and thanks to anyone reading, I know we're all having a really tough month. ",

Hopefully this is a straightforward application!\n\nI started filling out the form today to get a jump on it and it asks you for your relationship status. I am in a live-in relationship with a British citizen and we hope to formalise this soon, but not in the immediate future. Hence, I put down my status as 'Unmarried Partner'. When I got to the 'documents' section' of the application, I saw that the checklist included:\n\n\"Evidence you have to prove the relationship with 'Partner Name' (for example marriage certificates), and correspondence addressed either to you jointly, or in both of your names, or addressed individually to you at the same address, to cover the last two years\"\n\nI'm a bit stumped as my immigration status has never depended on my partner and I was not anticipating having to provide this. I have only 2 pieces of joint correspondence addressed to both of us (one from from 2022 and 2024), tenancy agreement with my name (and his name as the approved occupier) and a few pieces addressed to us individually showing the same address. I'm not sure how to prove my relationship status unless I supply texts, photos etc but I'm not sure if this is relevant as I'm not applying on the basis of this relationship. Is this going to be a serious problem with my application? For past applications, I've only had to provide my passports, BRPs and my PhD certificate. This has completely thrown me for a loop and I'm worried!",

We do not have any bills which are addressed to both of us, as the student housing requirements meant they had to be individual, though I\u2019m sure we could get a letter from our housing manager verifying we lived in the same flat for the last year. And both our names are on the lease of our house for next year. We meet the financial requirements through savings, and we have ample pictures, texts, plane tickets, statements from our flatmates, friends and family etc that show we have been in a committed, serious relationship for the last nearly 3 years. We even have the email records from last December of inquiring about a marriage license before deciding that marriage was not something we wanted to do right now financially/for family reasons.\n\nAll to say, i believe we meet all the requirements with the exception of 2 years cohabitation (we technically only have 1, though we lived in the same building prior and stayed with each other every night), and since we lived in student housing, which was the reason we didn\u2019t live together (we weren\u2019t given a choice by the uni), I believe that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\nhowever, I still feel quite nervous that we\u2019ll be rejected for some reason. my student visa runs out in October 30, and financially I can\u2019t afford to apply for the unmarried partner visa until early October. I know I\u2019m allowed to remain in the UK while awaiting a decision even if my other visa runs out (I believe the law is called Section 3C), but if we\u2018re denied for any reason I know appeals take months or longer, and returning to the US would be incredibly costly and difficult (not to mention cost of reapplying if needed), especially as I have signed a lease in the UK and will have accepted a job offer here by then as well.\n\nif anyone who has been through the unmarried partner visa process (successful or denied), or knows a lot about it, has any thoughts or insights to share on if we\u2019d likely be approved, or just advice, that would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\\*\\*note in case anyone was wondering: because of attending university i am eligible for a 2 year graduate visa, but it doesn\u2018t count towards the 5 year residence requirement for citizenship, which is my ultimate goal as my partner, friends, and work are in the UK, hence why i am applying for this (much more complicated haha) visa instead!",

    "selftext": "Good evening. I\u2019ve spent a few hours in this helpful sub to gather some information and create my questions.\n\nI\u2019m now closing in on my Family Visa expiration date in just under 3 weeks so I\u2019ve been familiarising myself with the checklist and requirements for gathering documents. I have just hit my 30 months since arriving in the UK. \n\nThe application is 33 months but because of covid and the Ukraine war beginning leading to many to flee to the UK, it led to a large backup in applications. So I couldn\u2019t properly book a flight not knowing if my approval would take 6 weeks or 6 months. On top of that, my carrier lost my package and I got my passport and documents back over a month later. Eventually leading to arriving in the UK 75 days after the start of my visa approval. So I didn\u2019t have a planned date. \n\nWith that being said I have some important questions regarding renewing for FLR:\n\n1. If I apply about 10 days from my visa expiration date, it will add +30 months to my ~30 months ~7 days. So my next application can be Indefinite Leave to Remain? \n\n2. If the answer is yes, would that mean I have to be quite tight in my timing and have to apply within around 2 weeks from my FLR expiration? \n\n3. I read in here that I\u2019m legally in the UK even after visa expiration as long as I applied before the expiration on grounds of section 3c. And that all the time spent in the UK after expiration also count towards the 60 months in the UK. Is this correct? If so this seems like a longer approval from Immigration could be beneficial in giving me more time towards ILR so I can apply earlier if I\u2019m not mistaken.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for such a lengthy post that definitely has rambling and I appreciate those that took the time to even glance at this. I\u2019ve looked for this information because I really want to make sure to avoid having to apply and pay for another FLR when I don\u2019t need to. Thank you.",

However, when I was granted the pre-settled status (march 2020) I was already living in Germany. I lived in Germany for the last 5 and a half years. In late March this year, I got an email from the [UK.gov](http://UK.gov) visa and immigration bureau saying that I got a 5 year extension for my pre-settled status.\u00a0Could you please tell me if this means that I can move back to the UK whenever I want to?\u00a0Can I make use of my pre-settled status although I haven\u2019t been living in the UK since 2020?\u00a0If I move back to the UK in two years, what will happen after this 5 year extension (March 2030)?\u00a0 \n\n\n\nMy pre-settled status passport, is an old one and I've traveled back and forth these past 5 years to the UK and back and I never had a problem albeit I used a different (new) passport, and not the one linked to the pre-settled status. \n\nHowever, I'm going to England for a graduation (just a short weekend) in September. and I am afraid that if apply for the ETA, my pre-settled might get cancelled at the airport (if stopped by customs) OR if I don't apply for an ETA and link my new passport to the pre-settle status, it will also cancel as it will detect that I haven't lived there for the past years. \n\n  \nWhat do you recommend me doing? I am asking this because I am tired of living in Germany, and I want to move back to London (as I'm staying a Master's degree there, online) and I'd like to know what my possibilities are.\u00a0\n\nThank you so much for your time and I wish you a great rest of the week.",

    "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI\u2019m hoping someone can give me some advice because my partner\u2019s immigration case with the Home Office has become a nightmare and we are at odds end of trying to get a resolution.\n\nMy partner applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain (Tier 1 Entrepreneur) in April 2024. This was essentially a renewal - we provided the exact same information and evidence that had been approved during his last two extensions. Despite this, the application was refused in July 2024.\n\nThe reasons were:\n\n* They claimed one employee couldn\u2019t be counted because he was already \u201cundertaking employment\u201d, even though he was previously just a director/investor and not an employee.\n* They questioned the genuineness of another employee despite that same person having been accepted as genuine in the previous application. We also submitted payslips, tax records and correspondence showing his work.\n* They questioned the viability of the business, even though that isn\u2019t a requirement for ILR and the company was clearly employing people and operating as normal.\n\nWe submitted an Administrative Review a few weeks later.\n\nAlmost a year went by with no update (besides an update after 6 month after no update was given and he chased with just a response that 'It's taking longer than usual for Administrative Reviews, up to 12 months or more\"). Then in June 2025, out of nowhere, the Home Office said the AR was automatically withdrawn because they believed my partner had left the UK the previous year.\n\nWe sent in clear evidence showing this was completely wrong with bank statements, Uber receipts and even an email from the airline saying he was a no\u2011show on the flight.\n\nHere\u2019s the bit that makes no sense:\n\n* On 10 July the Home Office Complaints Team wrote back upholding our complaint. They admitted their error and said they would reinstate the AR.\n* The very next day, a completely different department sent a letter ignoring all of that and saying the AR was still withdrawn.\n\nSo now there are two official Home Office positions that directly contradict each other. No one will confirm which one stands, and it\u2019s been over a year since the AR was first submitted. My partner can\u2019t travel, his business has been severely affected, and the stress is awful.\n\nI\u2019ve gone to my MP (my partner\u2019s MP has just been fobbed off with standard \u201cwait and see\u201d replies) but I don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nHas anyone been through anything like this?\n\nIs there any point escalating to the Independent Examiner of Complaints or Parliamentary Ombudsman?\n\nWould a Judicial Review be the only way to force them to act?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be massively appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a Turkish citizen and I\u2019ve been in a relationship with my British fianc\u00e9e for around 17 months. I\u2019ve applied for a Marriage Visitor Visa twice before, and unfortunately both were refused. Now, I\u2019m preparing to apply for the third time \u2014 mostly because my fianc\u00e9e really wants us to try once more before giving up.\n\nHere\u2019s my situation:\n\t\u2022\tIn my first application, I made a big mistake by not submitting proper bank statements or work-related documents. I was inexperienced and didn\u2019t know better.\n\t\u2022\tIn the second application, I included those documents and even added extra evidence \u2014 but I still got refused. One of the main reasons was that my documents weren\u2019t translated into English by a certified translator.\n\t\u2022\tI submitted a Pre-Action Protocol (PAP) complaint to challenge the decision, but it was rejected. From that process, I learned that any document not in English or Welsh must be translated by a certified/sworn translator \u2014 which I didn\u2019t know before.\n\nNow, I\u2019m rebuilding my application from scratch. I\u2019m getting all my Turkish documents officially translated by a sworn translator, and preparing a complete and transparent file.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nHere\u2019s my big question:\n\nI have two bank accounts:\n\t1.\tInactive account: I used this in my previous visa applications. I put some money into it specifically for the trip, but I don\u2019t normally use it. The visa officer considered it suspicious and thought I was hiding my real financial situation.\n\t2.\tActive account: This is the one I use daily \u2014 for receiving customer payments, shopping, and sending/receiving money to/from my siblings. However, some transactions don\u2019t include clear references or explanations. Over the past 6 months, around \u00a36,000 has gone in and out.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhich account should I use in my new application?\n\t\u2022\tThe active one, which truly shows my financial life but looks messy?\n\t\u2022\tOr the inactive one, which is cleaner but unrealistic?\n\nI want to be fully honest and transparent this time. We just want to get married legally in the UK and spend a short time together. I\u2019m not planning to stay long-term yet \u2014 we\u2019ll apply for a spouse visa in the future.\n\nIf anyone has gone through something similar, or has experience or advice, I would really appreciate your help. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nThank you so much!\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I could really use some advice or reassurance from anyone who's been through something similar.\n\nA few months ago, my UK student visa was rejected. The reason they gave was that they didn\u2019t think I was a genuine student. Honestly, I was just really nervous during the credibility interview and didn\u2019t explain myself properly. I didn\u2019t expect to get so overwhelmed, and I feel like I messed up my answers.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve spent time getting everything in order. I\u2019ve prepared much better for the interview, my finances are sorted, and I\u2019ve found a different university that I actually really like. I applied through Clearing and they said they\u2019d hold a credibility interview. If I pass that, they\u2019ll issue me a CAS and then I can apply for the visa again for the same September intake.\n\nBut this is where I\u2019m stuck. A lot of agencies in Bangladesh keep telling me not to do this. They\u2019re saying that if someone applies twice in the same session, like September to September, the second application gets rejected automatically. I\u2019ve tried looking online but I haven\u2019t found any official UKVI guidance or posts from people confirming whether this is actually true.\n\nSo I\u2019m asking here: has anyone ever applied again in the same intake after a visa refusal and actually got accepted? Is it really a rule that they reject you just because it\u2019s the same session? I just want to know if it\u2019s still worth applying or if I\u2019m risking everything by trying again.\n\nThanks so much if you\u2019ve read this far. I\u2019d really appreciate any help or advice.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone. I wanted to share my experience applying for a UK student visa with a passport from a high risk country. \n\nFirstly, I applied from Dubai where I have residency, which helped immensely. My university actually told me that I would be treated as someone from Dubai rather than someone from my home country, which was a relief.\n\nSecondly, something that my university did which I don\u2019t think many other universities did (based on what I read on Reddit) is that they themselves approve the documents that I should upload before they issue my CAS. They even did a mock interview with me in case UKVI hit me up for an interview (which they didn\u2019t) but it was appreciated that they wanted to prepare me as much as possible.\n\nLastly, I did not have any sort of sponsorship. I applied as self funded.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\nJuly 1st: applied and did my biometrics on the same day.\n\nJuly 2nd: got the generic email saying that my visa will be delayed beyond the promised timeframe. \n\nAfter two weeks, I made a paid inquiry, but they said that it\u2019s still under process.\n\nJuly 28th: after almost a month, I finally received the email that my application has been successful.\n\nSide note: my university told me that they could also submit an inquiry to UKVI which might help with the application to be processed faster, but that they will only do so if the dates are cutting close for my enrollment. Luckily, we didn\u2019t reach that point as my study starts in September.\n\nNote that I paid for priority service so it should\u2019ve been done within 5 working days, but it stretched to almost one month. They did not ask me for any additional documents or request an interview or any communication. My best guess is that the reason why it was so delayed was because of background/security checks due to my nationality.\n\n**Documents I submitted:**\n\n1- Passport copy\n\n2- Bank statement (28 days)\n\n3- UAE visa residency copy\n\nMy university was very strict with me to only upload the documents that the university itself approved in advance, and to not upload any additional documents. I listened to their advice and it worked perfectly.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nI am happy that I paid for priority as I was about 8 weeks from my planned trip to London. If I wasn\u2019t an applicant from a high risk country, I would\u2019ve stayed with standard since I still had two months. \n\nShare your documents that you want to upload in advance with the university for them to approve. \n\nLastly, don\u2019t stress. Unless there\u2019s something wrong with the documents that you shared, it is highly unlikely for you to be rejected. If I can get it, then anyone can.\n\nI would be happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\nCheers",

I also noted that I could always get a hotel room or an AirBnB for a week or two whilst looking for a flat to rent. \n\nI am not going to be living on campus, and have not reserved uni accommodation. Does anyone know if I should still provide additional clarification (e.g. a hotel room booking and/or a paragraph explaining that bit in detail in my cover letter)?\n\nAny advice is appreciated :)",

As I've not been working since Jan and just living off my savings, is this going to be a massive problem (I intend on going back to work soon and earn around \u00a350k)\n2. She doesn't work herself, she gets dividends from her mothers natural gas business in the region of \u20ac120k a year.

Things to note or causes confusion when filling the form: \n\n1) Select the sponsor's (person having ILR) visa as global talent visa in the application portal. \n\n2) A minimum of three year extension should be taken (this can be provided to the system by giving a date three year from the date of application as the end date of sponsor's visa (the person having the ILR)). In my case, an extension of two years would have made my partner eligible for their ILR application, and I provided a visa end date two years from the day of application and paid appropriate IHS. Home office later contacted us via email and made us pay an additional year IHS. \n\nI could not find any information regarding the necessity of 3 year extension in any of the FAQ or information from home office.

They provided a letter of confirmation of sponsorship to my university, but did not provide one to me, so I assumed I didn't need it for my app. Also, I'm from a differential evidence country, so did not provide any financial documents when applying.\n\nI've been spiralling down this subreddit (bad, I know), and realised I may have made a mistake:\n\nFor the question of \"If you are being wholly sponsored by an official financial sponsor how will you prove this?\u201d, I answered\u00a0**\u201cMy Student sponsor has confirmed this information on my CAS\u201d**.\u00a0\n\nThis is because I read this in my CAS:\u00a0\"***Please note that this is a sponsored student as evident by the letter of confirmation from their official financial sponsor****\",*\u00a0and interpreted this to mean that information of my sponsorship has been confirmed within the CAS itself. However, from what I\u2019m reading online, this is only if the university is sponsoring me, and I should have instead selected the option of providing a letter of financial sponsorship. \n\nI know I don't have to supply financial evidence anyways, but just wondering if this clash (i.e. me stating that my student sponsor confirmed it on the CAS vs my CAS stating that it's evident on the letter of confirmation) could be detrimental for my visa outcome? I know I can gather the relevant documents if they request it further down the line, but am really worried this inconsistency could be confusing and lead to an outright refusal. I've sent in an email to my university's international students team for advice, but if anyone here who can provide advice, please please reply to this as I'm quite nervous about the whole visa app!

That wouldn\u2019t happen until **December\u202f2025**.\n\n**Why we applied now:**\n\n* If we wait until December, my visa will expire (Aug\u202f1) and we\u2019d lose our rented home, cause huge disruption, and I still can\u2019t work to rebuild savings.\n* We felt we had to apply \u201cearly\u201d to maintain lawful status, housing, and allow my wife to keep job searching.\n\n**Questions I\u2019m hoping to get advice on:**\n\n1. Has anyone successfully applied before holding the full savings 6\u202fmonths, using a **Letter of Explanation** or exceptional circumstances?\n2. Would a detailed **personal statement** and full disclosure of bank/investment fluctuations help, or just trigger a refusal?\n3. Any other advice? \n\nWe intend on applying by August 1 no matter what, because I am not in a position financially or mentally to leave my wife right now. I appreciate any pointers for the application - especially real examples of people who\u2019ve navigated a similar timeline squeeze. \n\nThank you so much!!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI recently applied for a UK visit visa for my mom (family visit) and it was refused under paragraphs V4.2(a) and (c) of Appendix V. The main reasons for the refusal were:\n\nShe is currently unemployed and declared no income, but her bank statement showed large unexplained deposits (~37,000 AED / ~7000 Pounds over a month), which raised doubts about her financial credibility - this was from the letter. \n\n[This is due to the fact that my mom doesn't work, and my father works in real estate so his monthly income fluctuates due to commission but has a salary certificate for 15,000 AED monthly (roughly 3000 or so pounds) and so he usually transfers part of his income for her to use for her purchases]\n\nThe caseworker also questioned whether she\u2019d leave the UK at the end of her visit, despite her stating that she would travel with me and return to her spouse who is in our country of residence (UAE).\n(I haven't booked my mom's tickets yet as I'm still waiting for my decision on my student visa)\n\nThey noted strong family ties to the UK (her brother-in-law and his family) and weren't convinced of her ties to our home country outweighed this.\n\nI want to reapply but I\u2019m unsure how to properly address these concerns, especially around her financial documentation and proving her intention to return. Any advice or experiences with similar situations would be really appreciated.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I decided to dive deeper into the HSMP case, mainly for understanding whether it could serve as a legal precedent to deter the HO / government from applying the lengthened 10-year ILR qualification period to those already on the \"route\" (or avenue / pathway, etc., whatever you like to call it!)\n\nFor amateur legal researchers like myself, there's a search engine for UK case laws here: [https://www.bailii.org/form/search\\_multidatabase.html](https://www.bailii.org/form/search_multidatabase.html)\n\nIf we search for \"HSMP Forum\" there are 26 results (as of today). \\[2\\] and \\[6\\] below are the main case laws, and we already know that they contain the \u201clandmark\u201d rulings that were in favour of the migrants. Now we are interested in whether there are **any other cases that were ruled in favour of migrants (against the HO / government), using the two case laws above as precedents?**\n\nSee some short comments - in most cases just quoting the key point - on each of the cases below. **Apart from \\[13\\] and \\[17\\], where the claimants / appellants were HSMP migrants, all the other cases were ruled in favour of the HO / government. In my words, the HSMP Forum case law does not generalise well**. The key takeaway are the follows:\n\n* There must be a clear, unambiguous, unequivocal \u201cpromise\u201d that the terms won\u2019t change in the future, no matter what.\n* Even if the individual genuinely holds a legitimate expectation that their leave will ultimately be extended further by the Respondent, they have no absolute right to insist that this will occur, whether or not they meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the date of their application. (\u201cyou are likely to be eligible to apply for\u2026\")\n* If the group of affected people is large (> few thousands), then unfortunately the macro-economical reasons could prevail and override the \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d (see \\[23\\] and \\[25\\] below).\n\nDiscussions are welcome, but please discuss professionally in the context of case laws, not \u201cI feel\u201d, \u201cI guess\u201d, etc.\n\n\n1.

We\u2019ve been living in the US temporarily for a couple of years and since then had a child. We are trying to move back to the UK and get all 3 of us on her pre-settled status. Now the trouble is I have an international job and need to leave the country once every two weeks. So we were in the UK while I applied (note - it was my first entry since my old visa expired. I should have switched before it expired but have provided some rationale), but I had to leave again for work duties in the US. \n\nNow the good news is the CoA came through, but because I applied while on an ETA (as a visitor), it says I shouldn\u2019t leave and they won\u2019t let me back in while the application is pending. Obviously I already left, and this makes planning the move a massive headache with that uncertainty.\n\nGuidance however seems to indicate I can leave and return if I have a family permit (which is what we\u2019ve applied for my son). So what I\u2019m trying to figure out is:\n\n1. Can I apply for the family permit AFTER receiving the CoA \n2. Will they allow me to come in and out of the country with it while my application is still pending?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone.\n\nAs of writing this, I have double-checked all of my responses, but I do not feel confident proceeding with the declaration due to some of the sections. I am applying for a Student visa to pursue my Master's education.\n\nFirstly, the travel history section. I have meticulously cross referenced tickets, booking confirmations, etc., to have as accurate of a travel history outline as possible. But not only am I completely missing concrete information from when I was a minor on a Child Student Visa, (I am now applying from within the UK while on a graduate visa, having held a regular Student Visa beforehand). But I'm just generally paranoid about receiving a refusal due to just human error.\n\nWith residence, I am just a bit confused about the logistics of technically being resident at two properties at once. Almost exactly a year ago, I became a leaseholder of a property. However, that happened a month before my tenancy at the apartment I was staying at, waiting to be able to move into the purchased property, had ended. Therefore, in August 2024, I was technically a resident at both properties? I say this because my rent, collected on the first of the month, included council tax and bills. So, for all intents and purposes, I was a taxpayer at that rental for the whole of August 2024.\n\nLastly, the study details section is also confusing me a little. What is the difference between a higher education provider and but with a record of compliance? I have received an unconditional partial scholarship, so do I take it off the course fees information provided? Regarding all the sponsor information, does the university count as my sponsor as it is an internal scholarship?\n\nAnd lastly, the stupidest question is, what the hell do I put if there is no street number for my university? It is listed everywhere as \"\\*\\*\\* Lane\" That's it. When I search by postcode, the system even omits the street number, then tells me to input something. Do I just put \"0\"?\n\nSorry if I'm overthinking or if some of these questions are \"just Google it\" material. I'm just very paranoid, so I would want to hear from a real person as well.",

She applied for the first spousal visa online on 26/07/2020 - biometric appointment was on 07/08/2020 and we were emailed to say it was granted on 21/10/2020. The BRP for that visa had an issue date of  16/10/2020 and expired 16/04/2023 \n\nWe applied for the second spousal visa on  22/03/2023 and received an email to say it was granted on 05/04/2024. This BRP had an issue date of 05/04/2023 and has now transferred to an eVisa with an expiry date of 30/10/2025.\n\nI understand you can apply for SET(M) 28 days before the \u201cqualifying date\u201d so my question is - is the qualifying date 16/10/2025 as that\u2019s 5 years after the issue date of the first BRP? If so, we can apply on 20/09/2025. Or do we need to wait until 28 days before the current visa expires (30/10/2025) which would be 02/10/2025? \n\nAlso, during the first visa (in the height of Covid) my wife was back with family in China for 217 consecutive days. She explained the reasons for this in the second visa application and it was approved without issue. She will provide the same explanation with the ILR application. Could it cause issues? As I understand it there is no set maximum time outside the UK for SET(M) and she\u2019s been living with me and working in the UK consistently since then \n\nSorry for the lengthy post. Would appreciate any help. Thank you \n",

    "title": "UK Visa Experience (Pakistani Applicant in NJ)",
    "selftext": "Hey all, wanted to share my recent experience applying for a UK visa (standard visitor) as a Pakistani passport holder based legally as a non-immigrant in the U.S. I opted for the regular $179 (not premium) process and booked my biometrics appointment at the ASC center in Elizabeth, NJ \u2013 one of the few options available (others were in NY and Philly). Here\u2019s how it went:\n\n**Document Upload (a.k.a. digital pain):** They recommend uploading your documents 24\u201348 hours before your biometrics appointment. Since mine was right after a public holiday, I made sure to upload everything at least 24 hours ahead. But here\u2019s where the system gets... weird. I had merged a few PDFs (like any sane human would), but the portal kept throwing virus errors or would fail to properly render the files even after accepting them. I had to go through each file *individually*, re-uploading until I could *actually* view it post-upload. Archaic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. Pro tip: triple check that your uploads show up properly.\n\nI\u2019d prepped a notarized sponsorship letter, organized my financial docs, and included a utility bill to prove my sponsor\u2019s address. All good there.\n\n**Biometrics Day \u2013 ASC Theater Edition:** Application Support Centers are not exactly a beacon of customer service. You check in and sit in this waiting area where, I kid you not, you\u2019re expected to *gradually inch forward* every time someone ahead of you gets called once you are part of the waiting queue. Like musical chairs meets DMV purgatory.\n\nDespite uploading all my documents, they handed me a piece of paper afterward that was vague and honestly kind of misleading \u2014 suggesting I *might* still need to send docs via courier. Zero clarity, just vibes.\n\n**Shipping Fun (UPS Edition):** So yes, you *do* need to send in your passport and biometric confirmation page \u2014 and in my case, I threw in the visa application form again just to be safe (even though it should already be in their system). Went to UPS and asked for the cheapest 2-day option for both the send and return label. Cost me \\~$30, and the staff insisted I include a return envelope, but spoiler: **you don\u2019t need one**. They use their own return packet. Save yourself the confusion.\n\nI mailed it Tuesday, it left Wednesday and arrived at the UK Visa Processing Hub in NY on Thursday, and the decision was made by the following Tuesday, and my letter was dispatched the same day. That's a one-week turnaround post-docs, which honestly surprised me.\n\n**The Result:** The VFS informed me of a \u201cdecision made\u201d on my application\u2014 but not whether it was approved. That wait for the return delivery was full of suspense. But thankfully, I\u2019d organized my file well and my sponsor had sent all the right documentation, so the visa was granted \ud83d\ude4c\n\n**TL;DR Tips:**\n\n* Upload docs early and check each one actually displays post-upload.\n* The portal is clunky \u2014 be patient.\n* ASC centers are purely functional, don\u2019t expect clarity or assistance. They will refer to UK website which charge money to respond via email.\n* Send your passport + biometric confirmation, but no need for a return envelope.\n* Use the UPS app to track everything.\n* Be overly organized; it helps.\n* One final tip - if you aren't taking the premium package, addons such as mobile texts are not really necessary.\n\nHope this helps someone else going through the same process! Feel free to ask if you have Qs.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m posting this mostly out of anxiety regarding my student visa application... For context, I'm from a low-risk country, and this is my 2nd student visa for a masters course I\u2019m taking directly after my undergrad (i.e. no gap in between my studies). No contentious visa/travel history.\n\nAfter my biometrics appointment, I realised I made a few mistakes/did some things that might affect my application(?):\n\n* For self-uploading docs, I did not scan all pages of my passport [as per VFS guidelines](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/ind/en/gbr/supporting-documents), only the pages with my profile information on them. Is this an issue, since the visa centre is currently in possession of my passport anyways?\n* MAJOR ONE: I mentioned \"no\" when asked if I've applied for leave to remain in the UK but I just found out that it actually asks if I've applied for visa before which is yes...\n* For my UK and travel history, I noted down that I was in the UK for 10 months from Sep 2023 to June 2024, but forgot to mention I was out of the UK for a month in-between: I was in Japan for a holiday (though I did mention this Japan trip in my travel history)\n* When uploading my old passport (as it had evidence of my prev UK visa in it), I uploaded two copies\u2014the first time I uploaded, I forgot to add a particular page with some entry stamps, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to delete it, so uploaded a second corrected copy of my old passport. I labelled them quite clearly, but am not sure if this might confuse the caseworker.\n* Also a more minor issue but apart from the important documents (passport, document checklist, TB test) I also uploaded an official student status letter since I thought it would be helpful as proof of my masters course, but now I'm second-guessing and wondering if it might actually slow down the process since it wasn't mandatory?\n\nI\u2019m just wondering how major these issues are and whether they could be detrimental to my visa decision outcome? Particularly worried as I\u2019m scheduled to leave in less than 4 weeks and had opted for standard service. I know I can\u2019t do anything at the minute and should just wait, but it\u2019s tough not to think about it all the time haha\u2026 any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)",

According to the\u00a0[Skilled Worker caseworker guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-caseworker-guidance/skilled-worker-caseworker-guidance-accessible), I need to have spent a continuous 5-year period in the UK (not as a dependant), in any combination of eligible routes, including Skilled Worker.\n\nThe guidance also says that, due to COVID-19 disruptions, the time Tier 2 and Skilled Worker applicants spent working while waiting for visa decisions (between 24 January 2020 and 30 June 2021) counts towards the 5-year period, as long as they were in the UK with permission and the application met certain criteria.\n\n**My question:**  \nMy first job (when I actually started working) began on 17 August 2020\u2014before I received my Tier 2 visa, but during the COVID concession period.\n\nSo, does the 5-year period start from 17 August 2020, meaning I could apply for ILR from 17 August 2025? Or do I need to wait until 16 October 2025, when my BRP started?\n\nHas anyone had success applying using the concession? Also, does it make any difference if I opt for priority processing?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate your insights on a British citizenship timing issue.  \nI'm currently facing a dilemma between two core requirements that almost\u2014but not quite\u2014align.\n\n# \ud83d\udccc My situation:\n\n* First arrival in the UK for long-term residence: **12 September 2019**\n* **Left the UK: 28 July 2020**  due to COVID-related disruption and the shift to online education\n* **Returned: 9 January 2021**\n* Have been continuously resident in the UK since\n* **Settled status granted: 31 July 2024**\n\n# \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Citizenship requirements I\u2019m navigating:\n\n1. Be **physically present in the UK exactly 5 years before the application date**\n2. Have held **settled status for at least 12 months at the time of application**\n3. Not have spent more than **450 days outside the UK in the last 5 years**\n4. Not have spent more than **90 days outside the UK in the last 12 months**\n\n# \u2705 What I meet:\n\n* I plan to apply on **27 July 2025**, and I was **physically present in the UK on 27 July 2020** \u2192 \u2705 So I meet the **5-year physical presence requirement**\n* My **total absences in the last 5 years** = \\~**258 days**\n* My **absences in the last 12 months** = well under 90 days \u2192 \u2705 So I meet the **residency and absence conditions**\n\n# \u26a0\ufe0f What I don\u2019t quite meet:\n\n* My **settled status was granted on 31 July 2024**\n* Applying on **27 July 2025** means I fall exactly **3 days short** of the required 12-month period\n\nSo:\n\n* If I apply before 28 July \u2192 I meet the presence rule, but not the 12-month settled rule\n* If I wait for 31 July \u2192 I meet the settled rule, but miss the presence requirement (since I left the UK on 28 July 2020)\n\n# \ud83d\ude4f Why I\u2019m posting:\n\nI may not be in the UK in early 2026, so waiting until January to apply could become practically impossible.  \nI really don\u2019t want to lose my chance to apply for citizenship **just because of a 3-day technicality**, especially when I meet all other requirements.  \nI\u2019m wondering whether discretion might apply in this case, considering the COVID-related absence and how close the dates are.\n\n# \u2753My questions:\n\n* Has anyone successfully applied slightly before completing the 12-month settled status period?\n* Would a **cover letter** explaining the COVID-related absence and timing conflict help?\n* Or is this simply too risky, and should I wait?\n\nThanks so much to anyone who can share experience or advice \ud83d\ude4f\n\nUpdates: First of all, thank you so much to everyone who took the time to reply \u2014 I genuinely appreciate the thoughtful input and guidance.\n\nLet me address the key concerns raised:\n\n**\ud83d\udd39 1. Intention to remain in the UK**  \nYes, I *do* intend to remain in the UK long-term \u2014 not just in January 2026, but beyond. I\u2019m currently a PhD student and actively applying for postdoc positions or jobs in industry here. Unfortunately, due to how competitive the job market is, I haven\u2019t secured anything yet. That\u2019s why I mentioned I \u201cmight\u201d be abroad temporarily \u2014 purely out of necessity, not because I want to leave.\n\nBut to be clear:  \n\u2705 My preference is to stay and work in the UK.  \n\u2705 I\u2019m not applying just to \u201cget the passport and leave.\u201d  \n\u2705 In fact, many UK-based roles (both postdoc and industry) explicitly or implicitly favour British citizens, so having citizenship would *help* me stay.\n\n**\ud83d\udd39 2. Why not wait 3 more days?**  \nIf I wait until I\u2019ve held settled status for 12 full months (31 July 2025), then I no longer meet the **\u201cphysical presence in the UK exactly 5 years before\u201d** requirement.  \nOn **28 July 2020**, I left the UK due to COVID. My university moved fully online, and both my academic department and student accommodation *advised international students to return home*. I came back on **9 January 2021**.\n\nSo I\u2019m caught between the two criteria \u2014 waiting helps one, but disqualifies the other. I\u2019d rather be upfront about it than gamble or misrepresent anything.\n\n**\ud83d\udd39 3. Continuous residence issue?**  \nThanks for flagging this \u2014 I\u2019ve now carefully checked the Home Office guidance. My absence (28 July 2020 \u2013 9 Jan 2021) was **under 180 days**, and COVID-related. I meet the continuous residence rules with no concerns.\n\n**\ud83d\udd39 4. Was my settled status granted after 5 years?**  \nYes. Although my long-term residence started on **12 September 2019**, I had already been in the UK earlier for scientific preparation and internships. I believe the Home Office took this into account when granting my settled status in **July 2024** \u2014 I didn\u2019t apply early or under any exceptional clause.",

My FIL (63M) is legally disabled but doesn't really need any extra accommodations or special treatment. My MIL (53F) is currently the director of a non-profit event venue in the US and has a lot of experience in the field of venue and event managment.\n\nThey are currently mortgaging a home in the states and have about $80,000 equity in it which is increasing by about $15,000 a year and they are financially comfortable. They want to move to the UK and either start a small business (pub/shop) or my MIL would like to work in venue management.\n\nFor myself my wife and I have 2 children and our renting a house. We don't have any real savings but are slowly accruing some. We would ideally plan for my in-laws to live with us through their move here and retirement but we don't know what sort of Visa options would be available to them. They wouldn't be able to start the process for a few years due to other family circumstances but we wanted to get thinking of ideas now?\n\nTL:DR my In-laws want to move to the UK but don't have any big savings or a clear vision on how they would go about moving.\n\nAny advice or direction would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses I was think a skilled worker visa would be the only route so that's for confirming. They both have Irish heritage but from over 200 years ago so I can't see that being very helpful.\n\n Thank you all so much for the clarity.",

OR\n\n3) Do I need to pay and submit the application first before I can access the referee form? It means then no checks can be done anymore, I believe.\n\n4) I saw sample declaration forms online (that is, MN1 referee forms).

Assuming that the ILR requirement stays 5 years, I want to make sure I have everything in place for an ILR application. My understanding is as follows:\n\n* My new salary requirement for ILR will be the\u00a0[\"lower going rate\"](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-going-rates-for-eligible-occupations/skilled-worker-visa-going-rates-for-eligible-occupation-codes)\u00a0since my CoS was issued prior to 2024. Hence, for my job code, this should be \u00a342,600 at the time of my ILR application. Is this correct?\n* I am trying to ascertain the earliest date I can apply for ILR. There are three dates I'm looking at:\n   * Date of BRP issuance: 28/03/2021\n   * Date of Entry into the UK: 26/04/2021\n   * Date of application: 15/02/2021\n* Am I right in assuming that my period of continuous residence started on the date of BRP issuance i.e 28/03/2021? This would mean an early ILR date of 1st March, 2026?\u00a0I had no UK visa before my application for my skilled worker visa, so I am assuming I cannot use the covid exemption clause that states that continuous residence begins on the date of application?\u00a0\n* My husband's visa and entry into the country was 2 months after me and he is on a dependent visa. Am I right in assuming that we will need to extend his dependent visa by 2 months, and then apply for ILR once he completes\u00a05 years?\u00a0\n\nThank you so much :) ",

He has also supported me financially and emotionally over the years, although most transfers were made to my parents or grandparents in Romania, not directly to me.\nI was in the UK visiting him earlier this year, and we submitted my application from his home.

This table had the list of documents and a brief explanation of what each document contained. \n\nEvidenceWhyLivedApart.pdf - Payslips from both our companies and my husband\u2019s university transcripts. \n\nWhatsApp chats - Four screenshots from each month for the entirety of our relationship. \n\nThere\u2019s a 5 MB limit on the VFS portal so split the WhatsApp chats, photos, etc accordingly to meet this limit.

From 18 June to 11 July (I submitted my app on 12 July), it's 24 days. Prior to submitting, I was under the impression that the date you submit your biometrics is when the applicaiton is submitted (as in its sent off to the Home Office for consideration). I had my biometrics appointment on 15 July and 15 July is 28 days of consistently holding funds. When I received the email I realised I was wrong and that the day you submit your application online is considered date of submission. So 18 June to 11 July inclusive is 24 days. I have spoken to my bank who said they will provide me with a bank statement from 17 June to 12 July of my savings account and I am going to get a bank statement from 1 June to 24 July showing that even though I am short of the 28 days by 4 days, even after I submitted my application the funds never fell below \u00a32530 and my bank has agreed to provide me with a letter saying that the funds are above \u00a32530 in my current account (where the money is now) at any point.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience and has had their application approved?",

I want to register as a sole trader and apply for child benefits, but I\u2019m scared this might trigger a Home Office review and revoke my status. \n\nI currently live in the UK and (on paper) still hold EU pre-settled status. However, here's the issue: I left the UK during COVID and ended up living in a non-EU country for about 4.5 years. My wife was accepted to a UK PhD program and I was granted a five-year extension for my EUSS, so we decided to return.\n\nI\u2019m now trying to register as a sole trader. I started the process but paused when I reached the question: \u201cDid you come to the UK from a non-EU country in the past 12 months?\u201d It felt like a red flag. Also, I no longer live at the same address I used when I first got pre-settled status. I'm nervous that updating this info might cause more issues.\n\nTo complicate things, I received - like many others - an email recently saying the Home Office will check whether I\u2019m eligible for *settled* status. A month later, they responded with something vague: they couldn\u2019t determine eligibility.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping to apply for child benefits - with no nearby family, that support would really help - but I\u2019m hesitant. I\u2019m worried that completing these forms  might trigger a deeper review or give the authorities the kind of information that will lead to my status being revoked or a bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation - especially someone whose status *should* have lapsed? Did applying for benefits or registering as self-employed cause problems? Or did it quietly go through?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Is my father currently a British citizen? He would have been born as a British subject, then transitioned to CUKC in 1949, but did acquiring Canadian citizenship in 1947 affect his British status?\n2. If he is British, can he pass citizenship to me? The current [gov.uk](http://gov.uk) website suggests fathers can only pass citizenship if they were \"born in the UK\" or \"given citizenship in their own right\" - but my father got his British status through his UK-born father, and was born in Canada himself.\n3. Were the transmission rules different in the 1960s when I was born? Maybe the current restrictions didn't apply back then?\n\nI've gotten conflicting advice from two UK immigration lawyers - one says it's straightforward (my father is a citizen - go ahead and apply for Passport), the other says it's complicated and requires \"exceptional circumstances.\" Of course, the important question for me is, if we can get him a passport, does that help my citizenship case or am I left with Ancestry route for residency? (all 4 of my granparents were born in UK)\n\nHas anyone dealt with similar multi-generational Canada-UK citizenship questions? Any insights on how the 1947 Canadian Citizenship Act interacted with British nationality law?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance!",

I just wanted to ask (I know it\u2019s early since it was just approved) if there is anything I should do when he comes in preparation for the visa extension. I know it\u2019s not for a few years but from what I understand cohabitation proof needs to be shown over the full time period (every few months). So is there anything I should do now to prepare? \n\nThank you! ",

My understanding was that I could purchase a Super Priority (SP) slot and get my ILR decision early.\n\nI'm applying for the ILR (10-year route), and have submitted my application. There was only a standard fee available on the gov.uk application portal (the 3029.0 option, no Priority or Super Priority option), so I paid for that. Then I was redirected to TLScontact to book a biometrics appointment. (I am applying within UK). I assumed this was where I could find SP slots; however, I checked at 2 am last night and again at 4 pm today, and none of the locations have SP slots or P slots. Including London Gee\u202fStreet, Croydon, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and other locations. Were SP slots no longer available for ILR?

But I'm concerned about whether it\u2019s safe to travel before applying for the Graduate Route (PSW) visa. \n\nAs I understand it:\n\nYou can only apply for PSW after your university officially confirms course completion.\n\nYou must be inside the UK when applying for the PSW.\n\nIf I\u2019m in India when that notification happens, I might miss my chance to apply.\n\n\nShould I:\n\n1. Wait in the UK until the university confirms to UKVI and I apply for PSW?\n\n\n2. Travel in December and hope to return before the reporting is done?\n\n\n\nWould appreciate any guidance from people who\u2019ve been through this or know how Uni of Liverpool handles this timeline (especially on when they confirm results and inform ukvi). \n\nThanks",

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit Community,\n\nI got the global talent visa (GTV) with endorsement from the Royal Academy of Engineering on 20 Aug 2022, entered the UK on 23 Oct 2022 to collect the BRP, and left  the UK on 4 Nov 2022. I then got a university job later and reentered the UK on 3 Feb 2023, and have been in the UK ever since (except I go abroad for 6+6 weeks every year as part of my university teaching). My understanding is that I have not broken the 180-day rule in any 12- month period.\n\nI believe I can apply for ILR after 3 years of living in the UK. What\u2019s troubling me is the period from 20  Aug 2022 to 3 Feb 2023 when I was in the UK only for 12 days in that period. To play it safe, I believe I should apply for ILR on 6 Jan 2026 (3 Feb 2026 minus 28 days). However, any chance I can apply earlier given the visa situation right now? Will the absences between 20 Aug 2022 and 3 Feb 2023 delay my ILR application by the same period?\n\nSorry for this very long post. Any suggestions will be highly appreciated.",

Argued that I didn\u2019t need to show it for my previous entries this year (at least two other times this year) and many other times since the eVisa was introduced. I said that the info should be there on his screen but he insisted saying you still need to show and don\u2019t argue about what they can see. The officer also stamped my passport, which wasn\u2019t done before.\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s any new rules - saw online something about 2 June 2025 where BRP expired on 31/12/24 is no longer accepted, didn\u2019t know that was even the case. But not sure if it\u2019s related, and didn\u2019t find any info on gov UK website.\n\nSo just prepare the page just in case. I showed him very quickly and he was just glancing at it, not even checking the details. Not sure what\u2019s the point. I\u2019ve always thought the immigration officer wouldn\u2019t need to see it since they can check in the system, and the requirement was just before boarding since flight companies can\u2019t see the details other than using share code. I also don\u2019t know if this is isolated case, but the office seems very confident.\n\nAlso, glad that in the UK you could still argue your case with the immigration officer (softly of course, I didn\u2019t make a scene or raise my voice) and be upset without getting into trouble. He\u2019s just doing his job and was nice in the end.",

I am looking to apply to the YMS but to avoid being off work for too long (I dont think they would allow me to be off for very long) I was planning to do my biometrics in Spain (where my partner is from) as it is closer and cheaper than flying back to Canada. However I have been reading that I have to apply from a country I can reside in for more than 6 months, would that rule out Spain and force me to go back to Canada? \n\nAlso, I have read a few posts of people in similar situations as I am but I've not seen anyone mention the seemingly possible option of proving your identity through the UKVI Check ID app? Is this new? Does anyone have any experience with this? Would I possibly be able to apply from Spain through the App? What qualifies someone to prove their identity through the app as opposed to an in-person appointment? I think I used the app when I applied to my graduate visa but obviously that had to be done from within the UK, so it was not an issue for me at the time.\n\nFrom the YMS Apply page:\n\n\"As part of your application, you\u2019ll need to prove your identity. How you do this depends on where you\u2019re from and what type of passport you have.\n\nYou\u2019ll either:\n\n* use the \u2018UK Immigration: ID Check\u2019 app to scan your identity document - you\u2019ll also create or sign into your UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account\n* have your fingerprints and photo (biometric information) taken at a\u00a0[visa application centre](https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre)\n\nYou\u2019ll be told what you need to do when you apply.\"\n\nThank you in advance for any help and advice!!  \n",

The problem is, the Home Office has mixed up my surname and given name in their records (I think because my most recent travel document from them had the names swapped). All my previous applications such as extension and ILR were done with my name in the correct order, and my solicitor handled them all.\n\nNow, the registry office says my certificate will have the wrong name order unless it\u2019s fixed, but the Home Office told me there are only two options:\n\n1. Go ahead with the ceremony, get the certificate, then send it back for amendment (which could take up to three months).\n2. Ask the Home Office to amend it before the ceremony, but this could also take months and would mean delaying everything.\n\nMy solicitor wants to charge me a lot extra to deal with the amendment, even though I believe it\u2019s the Home Office\u2019s error, not mine. I\u2019ve already paid thousands over the years for immigration help and I do not want to pay more just for fixing a clerical mistake.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Has anyone else had this happen?\n* If you accepted the wrong certificate and sent it for correction, how long did it take to get the fixed certificate back?\n* Is there any way to speed up the amendment, or should I just go ahead with the ceremony and fix it after?\n* Did anyone ever get charged by the Home Office for a correction when it was clearly their mistake?\n\nThis is all very stressful and I\u2019d appreciate any honest advice or timelines from people who have been through it.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Is this standard advice while under Section 3C leave?\n\nI initially thought you are allowed to apply for a new visa while under Section 3C, and that doing so would automatically cancel the pending one.\n\nAlso, just to clarify: I submitted the current visa application before my previous visa expired, so I\u2019m lawfully in the UK under Section 3C.\n\nIf I do go ahead and apply for the Skilled Worker visa while still under Section 3C, will that break the continuity of lawful residence? I\u2019m concerned about whether this could affect future ILR eligibility, even though I\u2019ve remained lawful the whole time.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\nI\u2019m following up on a post I made a few months ago and could really use some advice or shared experiences.\n\nQuick context: I have settled status under the EUSS, and my partner (a Turkish national) applied for the EUSS under the durable partner route this past May (she's already in the UK, graduate visa). We've been together since November 2018.\n\nRelationship timeline in a nutshell:\n\nNov 2018 \u2013 Sept 2019: Lived together in the UK while studying\n\nSept 2019 \u2013 mid-2022: Long-distance relationship due to visa expiry + COVID travel issues\n\nSince mid-2022: Living together again in the UK under her current visa (student + graduate, expiring in Nov).\n\n\nWhile we did cohabit back in 2018\u20132019, the evidence is unfortunately a bit thin. We\u2019ve got some photos, a few Amazon deliveries to our shared address, and statements from family. After 2022, we\u2019ve got solid documentation: a joint tenancy, photos, shared bills, etc.\n\nWe submitted a detailed relationship timeline, travel history, photos from over the years and the current joint tenancy agreement. We also explained the lack of cohabitation was due to work/study commitments.\n\nToday we got an email from the Home Office requesting more evidence, specifically:\n\n**Evidence of your relationship to your unmarried (durable) partner**\n\n- Evidence that your relationship existed for at least 2 years by 31 December 2020 \n- Evidence that your relationship continues to exist on the date you applied \n\n**Examples of evidence to demonstrate a durable relationship**\n\nbank statements or utility bills in joint names at the same address \n\nresidential mortgage statement or tenancy agreement in joint names \n\nofficial correspondence that links you at the same address\n \nEvidence of joint finances, business ventures or commitments for at least 2 years by 31 December 2020: \n\ntax returns, business contracts or investments \n\nEvidence of joint responsibility for a child by 31 December 2020: \n\nthe child\u2019s birth certificate which names both parents \n\na custody agreement showing that you\u2019re living together and sharing parental responsibility \n\nI\u2019m a bit surprised about the request to prove our relationship is still ongoing, since we included photos from this year and our current joint tenancy agreement. I plan to add statements from our joint bank account and utility bills as further proof, but it does make me wonder how carefully our original evidence was reviewed\u2026\n\nAs for the pre-2020 evidence, it's honestly not clear to me if they want something that can put clearer dates on the relationship or if they're unhappy with the kind of evidence we provided (the wording doesn't seem to question the durability? But then again, maybe it's standard).\n\nWe also explained clearly that we don\u2019t have additional formal documents from that time.\n\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how best to structure the cover letter that will accompany our response to this request?\n\nAlso, are there any other types of informal or supporting evidence we might be overlooking that could strengthen our case?\n\nAppreciate any insights. Thanks in advance!\n\nP.S. I know we'd qualify for a family visa but the EUSS is overall better and cheaper, so we're exploring this option first",

Another lawyer told me no, I'd have to wait the 12 months, because you can't \"switch streams\" - the immediate application is only for those who got their ILR through a spousal visa route. \n\nWhich is correct?

It's only a matter of a few months likely for most people in this position, but the peace-of-mind value of each month is incalculable, so it does make a difference.\n\nHere's the rule if anyone's interested - SWV 21.2: [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-worker](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-worker)\n\nTLDR: if you applied for your work visa between 24 Jan 2020 and 30 Jun 21 (inclusive), you do not have to wait for 5 years from the date of your visa approval to apply for ILR... you can start counting your 5 years from the date you APPLIED, and apply for your ILR 28 days before that.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI hope you're all doing well.\n\nI'm reaching out to better understand the reasons for my UK Visitor Visa refusal and to seek your advice on how I can improve my application next time.\n\nFor context:  \nI applied from Qatar with a Sudanese passport to attend my graduation ceremony in Newcastle, England, on **July 14, 2025** (which has already passed). I planned to stay in the UK from **July 10 to July 18**\u2014a total of 8 days.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smaubv5dp1ef1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f439a86a4c0597bbf308d8516084cc80896775c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7h0co2aep1ef1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d4c7526b95ebe8aa10f1e2a964ccd53107495c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39a195jfp1ef1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1771ff1063e70bf33e4f8fc30e831eedc853c239\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odg0cs4hp1ef1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccbd4dcf71c7d7e62f5103888161fa35195788ec\n\nFrom what I understand, the refusal was based on the following points:\n\n**1. Additional Income Evidence:**  \nThe letter stated:  \n*\u201cThe documents provided do not demonstrate that you are in receipt of the above additional income.\u201d*  \n*\u201cThe documents you have provided do not demonstrate any corroborative link between deposits and your stated additional income.\u201d*\n\nIn my application, I indicated that I receive **19,200 QAR per year** in additional income (which is **1,600 QAR per month** for 12 months). The online application did not allow me to input a monthly amount, only an annual figure, so I entered the total.  \nHowever, this money is sent to me informally by my father each month as a form of support, without any official contract or agreement. It doesn\u2019t appear as a lump sum in either my bank statement or his, but it\u2019s consistent support from him out of generosity. I understand this may have caused confusion.\n\n**2. Financial Sponsorship and Intent to Return:**  \nAnother point mentioned:  \n*\u201cYou state that your father will be paying 20,000 QAR (\u00a33,976) towards the cost of your visit. While I take that into account in assessing your proposed maintenance and accommodation in the UK, this is only one aspect of the visitor rules, and this sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit.\u201d*\n\nI'm unsure what is meant by \"only one aspect of the visitor rules.\"  \nWhile I\u2019m currently doing an internship and have a modest income, my father is financially capable of covering the entire trip, which is why I provided his bank statement. I hoped that would be sufficient to prove financial support.\n\n**3. Personal and Economic Circumstances / Ties to Home Country:**  \nThe refusal also stated:  \n*\u201cYou do not have any dependents in your country of residence, do not appear to own any property, and the documents you have submitted do not demonstrate any investments or similar assets.\u201d*  \n*\u201cGiven this, I am not satisfied that you have substantial ties outside the UK to ensure you will leave at the end of your proposed visit.\u201d*\n\nI\u2019ve just completed my bachelor\u2019s degree, and I\u2019m still early in my career. I don\u2019t yet have dependents, property, or investments. I am actively applying for full-time jobs (over 100 applications so far), but I haven\u2019t secured one yet. That said, I\u2019m currently doing an internship, and I provided a letter confirming that it continues until **August 31, 2025**.\n\nI also submitted my graduation letter confirming that I completed my degree and that the ceremony was scheduled for July 14. My Qatar passport and ID are both valid until 2026.\n\nI\u2019m not writing to complain but to better understand what went wrong and how to strengthen my application for the next time. There is another graduation ceremony planned for **December 2025**, and I\u2019m considering reapplying for a UK visitor visa around **October or November 2025**. Before I do that, I want to make sure I improve my application and address the reasons for refusal properly.\n\nThank you for your time and any guidance you can provide.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I really need some advice.\n\nI'm due to travel in two weeks, but I'm facing a complicated situation with my immigration documents. My BRP (Biometric Residence Permit) expired on **31/12/2024**, and I understand that BRPs have been phased out and replaced by the eVisa system. However, my expired BRP is still the document associated with my UKVI eVisa account.\n\nI do have **valid immigration status until December 2027**, and I can generate a **share code** from my eVisa account that confirms this. The problem is that I can't add my **passport** to my eVisa account because of a **name mismatch** (my correct name does not match what is on the MRV).\n\nUKVI has instructed me to send my **physical passport by mail** to resolve this, but with such a short timeframe before my travel, this is not feasible. I'm now seriously concerned about whether I will face issues **re-entering the UK** after my trip.\n\nTo summarise:\n\n* BRP expired 31/12/2024\n* eVisa is valid until Dec 2027\n* Can generate a valid share code confirming permission to stay\n* Cannot link my passport due to name mismatch\n* Cannot send passport by mail in time to fix this\n\nHas anyone faced something similar? Will the expired BRP cause problems at the border even if my share code confirms I can stay until 2027? Any advice would be hugely appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Now the document checklist I was given only requires two things: my passport and permission from my financial sponsor.

I have lived in the UK since 2021 completing my bachelor's degree and the site says that if I have been living here for more than 12 months under a valid visa then I don't need to provide financial proof. I have travelled in and out of the country over the past 12 months but I am presuming that I qualify for this anyway?\n\n  \nHowever, I CAN provide proof and my parents are concerned, thinking that I might as well provide the documents whether or not they asked for it to not risk any delays or issues....\n\nMy question is: is submitting additional documents a bad idea? And can someone suggest whether I just leave it out as I qualify for the exemption...?\n\n  \nThanks for any help or advice!",

Told them my understanding is so long as the children apply before they turn 18, they can use the form MN1 without the life in the UK test and approved english test. If the children apply after they turn 18, they would have to have had the ILR for at least one year (which they would have), then pass life in the UK and have an approved english test. \n\nPersonally I would find that hard but I completely understand them about not affording all these fees at the same time considering the high cost of living. Anybody else did this or know anyone who did it or any inputs at all? Many thanks.\n\nEdit: they applied for fee waivers for the children but it has been denied.",

I didn't went back to the UK until August 2022 because I also had severe symptoms related to spring allergies such as asthma. I don't have a letter from the doctor to confirm this as I already had an inhaler - I've been allergic since I was a child. It was common sense to wait until summer as I didn't have a job in the UK nor a GP. I went back to the UK once I found a job I could afford myself live in the UK where I have lived since then. Do I have any chance to challenge the Home Office decision through an appeal? Anyone who knows how long does it take? I want to visit my family in my country and if I go I guess my case will be withdrawn. My other option is to apply for a skilled worker visa but my company doesn't sponsor and it's very hard to find sponsorship atm. ",

I paid for the **priority (fast-track) service** due to an urgent upcoming work trip. Just sharing my experience in case it helps others \u2014 or at least raises awareness about some of the issues.\n\nThe first problem happened when I received an unexpected **$99 invoice** from [**noreply@elavon.com**]() for \u201cDocument Upload Assistance.\u201d It was billed under only my **second last name**, even though my full application included both last names. The email wasn\u2019t clear, and I got suspicious. I contacted **UKVI directly**, and they told me I didn\u2019t need to pay anything extra. Turns out, **I actually** ***did*** **need to pay it**, or my supporting documents wouldn\u2019t be uploaded. Confusing and frustrating.\n\nThen, after receiving notice that my visa had been approved, I **emailed VFS on June 28** asking if I needed to include a new prepaid label for passport return. **No one ever replied** \u2014 just an auto-generated ticket number (G-04019403). I followed up multiple times with no actual help.\n\nOn **July 16**, I got a text saying my visa application was dispatched via **UPS**, even though I had enclosed a **FedEx prepaid return label**. I had no tracking info and didn\u2019t know which courier they actually used. Turns out, they used their own **UPS security pack** from the original passport retrieval (which I had already paid for earlier).\n\nFinally, my **passport arrived on July 18** with the visa stamped \u2014 but with **no tracking, no communication, and no confirmation** until the moment it showed up.\n\nIf you\u2019re applying from the U.S., just be aware:\n\n* **VFS Global has no working customer service phone line**\n* **UKVI can\u2019t help with VFS processing in the U.S.**\n* **Communication is minimal to nonexistent**\n* Even if you pay for priority, there\u2019s still a lot of waiting and uncertainty\n\nKeep records of everything, be persistent, and prepare for delays. I hope this helps someone going through the same thing!",

    "selftext": "I plan on applying to get my masters in clinical psychology in England as I have been intending to study and move there since I was 16. I'm from the US and have never liked it here. However, I fall more in love with England every time I visit. I'm currently looking into how plausible it would be for my partner to get a visa (especially one that allows him to work). I'm a bit confused and overwhelmed, though, since there are so many types of visas and different qualifications for them.\n\n1. If I get into a program and recieve a student visa, is it possible for my partner to get a visa as well? I have read that he can apply as a dependant, but that apparently only applies to the dependents of people getting doctorate degrees or are sponsered by the government. Is that the case across the board or is there a different way?\n\n2. If it is possible, which visa(s) would we need to apply for? Everything is so specific and I'm afraid of doing something wrong or missing an important step. \n\nIf anyone has any information or advice I would greatly appreciate it! ",

Thanks a lot to Reddit community. I used to see alot of posts here for guidance etc and would be happy to support others. \n\n**My timeline:**\n\n**15/07/2022 :** Arrived in the UK on a Skilled Worker Visa. Skilled Worker Visa start date was 15/07/2022.\n\n**17/04/2025** : Switched to a Global Talent Visa (Exceptional Talent). I was eligible for Fast track Endorsement and received it from Royal Academy of Engineering. I applied for GTV for 1 year. \n\n**11/07/2025 :** Applied for ILR (Super Priority), and booked booked biometrics appointment (free slot at UKVCAS Birmingham on 16/07 at 9:00 am). Although i was eligible to apply earlier based on SWV start date, but applied within 28 days from entry date to be on safe side. \n\n**16/07/2025 :** Attended Biometrics at UKVCAS Birmingham. I went early and biometric finished by 8:40 am.\n\n**16/07/2025 :** Biometrics Collection Confirmation email at 8:42 am.\n\n**16/07/2025 :** ILR Approval email received at 11:10 am.\n\nSo it took **2h:28min to get the decision** after the biometric. I think super priority is worth it for the piece of mind. I'm finally done now with all this visa shit show!\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI applied for a Dependant visa from within the UK using priority service. After completing biometrics at the end of June, I didn\u2019t receive a decision. UKVI escalated my case, and I was told via email on 9 July that the decision was sent by email on 30 June.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve never received any decision letter not in my inbox, junk folder, UKVI account, or by post. My eVisa still shows my old immigration status, with the standard message about staying in the UK while awaiting a decision.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve done so far:\n\n- UKVI escalation (twice) \u2013 most recent said \u201cthe appropriate team has been notified.\u201d\n- Filed a formal UKVI complaint. \n- Got my MP involved \u2013 they\u2019ve contacted the MP Helpline and marked it as urgent.\n\nDespite all this, I\u2019ve still received no formal outcome or update. This is now affecting time-sensitive plans.\n\n- Has anyone experienced something similar where UKVI claimed to have sent a decision but nothing was received?\n\n- Did you eventually receive the decision? Was a reissue triggered, or did they admit it hadn\u2019t been sent at all?\n\n- And if you involved your MP, how did that process go? Did it help get things moving or get a proper response?\n\nAlso wondering if anyone has tried linking their application number (UAN) to their UKVI account to refresh their eVisa, and whether that helped.\n\nThanks in advance \u2014 I\u2019m under a lot of stress and just trying to figure out what\u2019s next. Hearing how others navigated this would mean a lot.\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is just a post about my \"Life in the UK\" Test experience that I passed yesterday.\n\nI booked my test with eVisa by getting a share code. I had already taken my share code like a month ago and hadn\u2019t saved that share code as a PDF or screenshot. They asked me if I had it, and I said no. They asked me to get another share code. After I showed them the new share code, they let me into the room, and another guy was able to see my previous shared code on the system and told me I wouldn\u2019t need a new one because previous one is still valid.\n\nI had brought my passport with me just in case, but they didn\u2019t even check or look at it. But they do check whether the photo from the share code - evisa system matches with me or not.\n\nThe first 4 questions are sample questions, and the rest are the actual test questions. Generally, it is very quick. I took the test in Birmingham ->me going into the exam center, taking the exam, and going out took like 20 minutes max. The staff were very friendly and helpful.\n\nMy advice for whoever will take that exam is\u2014I don\u2019t know if I can share the link here\u2014but if you google \"Life in the UK Test Summary and Notes\" on the Scribd com website, there is a summary note uploaded by Danial. I highly recommend you check that.\n\nmy strategy:\n\nFirst, I read the book and printed out those notes and started to memorise. It\u2019s not about how much you study in my opinion. It\u2019s more about how fast you can memorise things.",

    "title": "Article 8 - Application Advice",
    "selftext": "I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with Article 8 - Right to Family Life applications? I know they are supposed to be very difficult but I think it is my only option at the moment.\n\nI don't want to go into ridiculous detail so I'll try to keep it succinct. As other's have said in other forums, immigrations don't always seem to get it right. I consulted with one before and she wasn't very useful. She basically tried to scare us to hire her and got things wrong (maybe intentionally). Though I have never practiced, I have a law degree so have been researching myself but want to see if other people have insight.\n\nI am British, with no other cultural influence. My parents are British and so on going back to before there were records. Just stating this to say I have no other country connections through heritage. My wife is American, she only has a US passport. We met when we were both working as teachers in Asia about 15 years ago and we have been married for 10 years. We moved to other 3rd party countries as it was easier than living in the UK and neither of us wanted to live in the USA. In the last country we lived in together, we ended up having children, they are now 3 and 6. Both have British passports. - So we can easily demonstrate that our relationship is real.\n\nI was made redundant from my job unexpectedly where I was earning over \u00a350k a year in the Middle East. Because of the high cost of living in that country, we decided to leave as soon as possible. So our leaving was done in an emergency fashion and would not have been how we wanted to do it. So we are now in the UK, myself and the kids on our British passports and my wife as a tourist. She is staying with us but has not started living in the UK in any way that would go against her visa. Her visa is over half way through now.\n\nWe are currently living with my mum, rent free for as long as needed with our children.  - So can show we have accommodation.\n\nOur intention was to use Category B for the financial requirement and then I would get a job that met the requirements in the UK, my wife would briefly return to the US to apply and then come back on the spousal visa. However, despite my attempts to find a job, it is taking considerably longer than expected. I have applied for about 60 jobs, from that I've had two 15 minute interviews and 2 full interviews and got nothing. Ghosting people is crazy here. I am still actively applying and have potentials but the process is so slow in the UK, in each case that led to interview from application to interview alone took about 6 weeks. Another job I recently applied for would not start until December which is after her visa expires. - So basically, I am currently failing to meet financial requirement and even if something comes up sooner, it's still getting too close to her having to leave. If she has to leave, there's no telling how long she would then need to be away for as it might take so long to start in a role that the ability use Category B expires.\n\nMy arguments are this: \n\nPrimary: It is in the best interest of the children.\n\nMy children are both British citizens and so have the right to live in the UK. Our daughter is 3 and very attached to her mum. She has settled well into the UK since we arrived in March and enjoys being around our family for the first time. Our son is 6 and has a considerable speech delay and suspected autism though we could not get decent support for him where we were living. He has started school here and is about to complete his second term. The school is helping us get a proper diagnosis but again, it's a lengthy process. However, being here is benefiting him greatly, he is now getting the support he needs, and the improvement has been really comforting. Though the kids are technically dual nationality, we never got them American passports.\n\nSecondary: Insurmountable odds\n\nThe second argument is that we can't afford to leave the UK as a family. It cost us almost everything we had to clear our debts where we were and get to the UK, and I had to borrow money from my family to do it. We no longer have residency or employment in the country we left and there are no third party countries we can move to now we have children. The only other connection to another country is the US. \n\nHowever, we cannot move to the US either. I mean in all honesty, we do not want to move there but even if we did, we couldn't. Firstly, we would have to get the kids US passports which would be costly. Second, I could not go, part of the sponsorship requirements is that the sponsor is resident in America which she is not and has not been for 15 years. She doesn't even maintain a bank account there. Third,  we would have nowhere to live there. My wife is estranged from her mother, and hasn't seen her father since she was a child. She has siblings but none that could provide us with accommodation or support while getting set up.\n\nTertiary arguments:   \n\\- The ability to not meet the financial requirements is only temporary. I am still actively looking for employment. I have two masters degrees and almost 20 years experience in the education field though I am not QTS qualified. My wife also have over 15 years experience in education, has a masters degree and an PGCEi though not QTS.  \n\\- Zero cost to the tax payer. We are still willing to pay NHS fees and other fees and we are not claiming any kind of benefits or universal credit. My wife has no mental or health issues either underlying or preexisting.  \n\\- We will both end up in the workforce as tax payers.  \n\\- Though my son is currently in mainstream school at tax payer cost, he is a British citizen and would be entitled to it even if my wife wasn't here.  \n\\- We would still transition over to a spouse visa once we are able.  \n\\- We have enough money and family support to sustain ourselves.  \n\\- If my wife did have to leave, it would still not be possible for us to follow her and I would no longer be able to apply for employment as there would be no one to act as their primary care. Though my mum is healthy, she is still 68 and it would be unreasonable to expect her to act as a complete replacement for their mum. This means, I would have to start claiming benefits as a single parent.  \n\\- My wife is Latina heritage. Under the current US administration, this means a genuine risk of detainment for no reason. Also, because we had colleagues from Gaza, we have shown sympathy for Palestinian (not Hamas) citizens on social media which is still enough to get you arrested in the US at the moment. So there is a fear of detainment again.\n\nSorry, I really sucked at being succinct. Any feedback is appreciated. I'm mostly unsure of how to structure it. I have read through the case law and understand the leading cases which have read positively but obviously this was never the way I thought I would have to do this.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Will I be able to fill the visa application on behalf of my partner (she will be outside of the UK at the time - Poland, while I will be in the UK) ?\n\n2. I've managed to get my notice period shortened at my current job which will result in a smaller pay on this months payslip and I will be starting my new job mid next month which will also take 2 weeks out of my new UK payslip. Could this have any impact on proving the financial capability to support my partner. I've done this to have more time to take care of formalities before flying out to the UK.\n\n3. Could I use my mothers address on the visa (2 bed flat - currently occupied by her and my younger brother who is a minor) with me and my wife this would make 4 of us. I just want her to be with me ASAP and I'm not sure how long will it take me to rent a house for us - eg. I've rang an agency today about a property posted 1 day ago and the viewing queue is already full which has concerned me.\n\n4. I do recall someone referencing a handbook which served as a guide as to what documents are considered what tier, but for the love of me I can't find it on the UK gov website. I just wonder about the required format of the documents. So far we've got our marriage certificate, earnings statement from previous employer, my PL payslips for the 01/25 - 06/25 period, my PIT for last tax year which is the equivalent of P45 in the UK - All translated by a sworn translator here in Poland and stamped by him, offer letter from the current company based in the UK stating my salary. I also plan on extracting a bank statement from my bank showing all the transfers made by my partner to my account (this will be in english - PDF fromat.\n\nAgain, I would appreciate any comments. Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation - or I'm just being overly anxious as I've really got a lot going at the moment.\n\nCheers\n\n\n\n",

We're very committed to each other and fully intend to marry and live together as soon as we can. I'm a UK citizen, living in Scotland all my life, she's from the United States.\n\nOur main concerns are the financial/income requirements and the fees as we are both in pretty low-paying jobs and the incredibly high financial barrier seems near impossible for us to reach. We're also not sure of the best plan of action for which visa to apply for if we want to get married as soon as possible.

This seems illegal to me, and I also think this will affect my ILR application if/when I apply next year, as the subsidiary name does not match the CoS. I will say the names are very similar, eg. TS Hairdryer would be the parent company and Hairdryer Sales Ltd. would be the subsidiary. But they are not exact. Any thoughts?\n\n",

To simplify the assessment of continuous residence, these changes enable a pre-settled status holder to be granted settled status where they have been resident in the UK for at least 30 months in total in the most recent 60-month period. This can be any 30 months within that 60-month period.\n\n(from https://freemovement.org.uk/changes-to-the-absence-rules-for-eu-settlement-scheme/#If\\_pre-settled\\_status\\_holders\\_only\\_need\\_to\\_show\\_25\\_years\\_of\\_UK\\_residence\\_do\\_they\\_still\\_need\\_to\\_wait\\_for\\_5\\_years\\_to\\_apply).\n\nI'm a bit confused whether I qualify.

I was granted the pre-settled status through them on Sep 2020 as they\u2019re an EU citizen. We were married for more than 3 years, lived together in the UK for 3 years and divorce happened when the two of us were still living here.\nAt the time of the divorce the research I did pointed out that I had retained rights of residency and that I should just wait until it was time to apply for my settled and provide documents to support that.\nNow that it\u2019s almost time to apply for the settled I have been gathering documents but research has changed.\nApparently I now would have to tell the home office I got divorced (which did not come up at any point on my research back in 2023) which will trigger the 60 days for me to change my status or leave the UK, then apply for the retained rights of residency that can take up to 6 months to review, and then Re-apply for the the pre-settled?\nI thought the retained rights of residency for these cases on the pre-settlement were something a person automatically has if all requirements are met, not something we have to apply for?\nAnd how would the timelines work if I only have 60 days to change my visa if the review of the next step (retained rights residency) can take up to 6 months?\nAll this information seem very conflicting to me. I tried looking for legal advice but the office said they can\u2019t help me and now I\u2019m trying to find another place.\nI just wanted to know what the step by step process is so I can do it, as currently I\u2019m relying on scrambled information across multiple websites.\n\nI\u2019m also freaking out that in light of everything I am overstating my visa and the settled will be denied now \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI found this thread that shows exactly my situation, but replies are from 2 years ago so I\u2019m afraid things have changed https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1892sv9/retained_rights_of_residence_what_happens_to_a/\n\nThese are the \u201cofficial\u201d websites that I could get info on (bearing in mind at the time of my 2023 research, other gov websites were in place, that said different things): \nhttps://www.gov.uk/visas-when-you-separate-or-divorce\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/family-permit/apply-retained-right-of-residence\n\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/immigration/applying-to-the-eu-settlement-scheme/switching-from-pre-settled-to-settled-status/\n\nMany many thanks I\u2019m advance if anyone can help me!",

So I book this appointment, it's on Friday, and I'm looking at the supporting documents checklist, and it is saying that I only have to upload my passport and nothing else. It explicitly states I do not need to show proof of finances or education certificates. Now I'm trying to upload my passport before my appointment and this vfs global has given me this long list of documents to upload, which I was told I will not have to show. Can someone help? Am I missing something? Can I just bring the passport to my appointment or do I absolutely have to upload it to this thing beforehand?",

We are about to meet in person for the first time at the end of this month. We want to get engaged and apply for a fiance visa for him to come to the UK so we can get married, switch to Spouse visa and settle together here. But we're concerned about proving our relationship is genuine and are worried that having met only once for a week, getting engaged during that week and then applying quickly after for a fiance visa will look unconvincing. Does anyone have experience with this/relevant knowledge? We want to do everything as quickly as possible BUT we do not want to submit a pointless application that will never work and have it refused (we simply can't afford to keep applying over and over until we get it). We want to be sure we're doing the right thing, and if it means we have to slow things down and meet more times over a longer period, we'll have to suck it up and accept that.\n\nSomewhere we read that regardless of how long the relationship has lasted, the Home Office considers the beginning of your relationship to be the first moment you meet \\*in person\\*, and that you'd need to be together for at least almost a year from that point for it to be considered good enough. However, one of the lawyers we consulted with told us that we could get away with not meeting in person at all before applying, because we had very good excuses as to why traveling and meeting in person is difficult for us (limited finances, my disabilities, the current situation in Russia and the fact that we are a same sex couple).\n\nSo much of the info and advice we find seems to contradict each other and we're more confused than ever. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Hello people,\n\nI\u2019m a US citizen currently on a Skilled Worker (Tier 2) visa in the UK, and I\u2019ve just been told my role is at risk for redundancy. I\u2019ve been in the UK since Nov 2020 (student visa for 1.5 years -> grad scheme for 1.5 years -> skilled worker for ~2 years), and been with my current employer for 3.5 years.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t company wide, but a few other roles have been affected. I\u2019m the only one on sponsorship however. \n\nI believe my sponsorship will expire in December 2025. \n\nHere\u2019s my current situation:\n- I work in Ops/Product. Will probably be looking for roles in this remit, especially junior PM. \n- I\u2019ll be on 2 months\u2019 garden leave (paid as normal)\n- My visa is tied to my current employer (they are the sponsor)\n- There may be a potential internal fixed term role (in a different department) I could move into. It\u2019s not confirmed though. And it would be technically a regressive step backwards in development and salary. \n\nI\u2019m trying to get clarity and advice on:\n1. how does the 60 day grace period work? I\u2019m seeing it can take months after the Home Office is notified to even get the letter, is that still true? \n\nI\u2019m just nervous on the newer immigration policies put forth by the government recently. The market\u2019s already really tough, I\u2019m anxious about my chances as needing a sponsorship. \n\n2. How early should I disclose to new/prospective employers that I need a sponsorship (early in interview?) \n\n3. Any advice re that internal FTC role? Part of me wants to just dive into the job search and fully focus on finding my new product role, but the other part wants the security that would come w staying (at the expensive of an ego hit and slight reduction in pay.. probably \u00a35k reduction). This could be refused though btw. \n\n4. Any general advice from people who\u2019ve navigated redundancy while on a Skilled Worker visa?\n\nI\u2019ve built a life here and want to stay. I was hoping to even try to make it for ILTR. I have friends for life here, and built some really strong professional connections that are already v happy to help me network. I\u2019m just really hoping I can figure out a path forward that\u2019s realistic. And a junior PM requiring a sponsorship in this market for roughly the same salary feels daunting. \ud83d\ude30\n\nAny advice or insights from people who\u2019ve been through something similar would mean a lot.\n\nThanks so much \u2764\ufe0f\n",

We\u2019re planning to get married in Ireland in December 2025, and then apply for a Spouse Visa in the U.K. in March 2026, when I\u2019ve been working for 6 months and can therefore supply all my payslips, proving that I\u2019ll be able to support both of us living in London together.\n\nHowever, since we\u2019ve been pursuing our relationship in long distance for the past few years, she\u2019s keen to come to the U.K. to live with me as soon as possible. As such, our plan was to first apply for a tourist visa in October. Since the U.K. gives tourist visas for 6 months, she could feasibly live with me from October-March on a tourist visa, then return to Russia while we wait for the spouse visa application to be processed.\n\nIn reality, we\u2019re aware that if she stayed in the U.K. for the full 6 months on a tourist visa, there would likely be questions asked when she goes to apply for the spouse visa after. We want to know how long she could realistically stay in the U.K. (3 weeks? 3 months?) over the course of October-March on her tourist visa without this leading to problems down the road when applying for a spouse visa. In her tourist visa application she\u2019s writing that she only plans to stay for 2 weeks, since it\u2019s unlikely to be approved if she applies for longer than that (again, I haven\u2019t started working yet, so can\u2019t prove that I have the means to support her during her stay).\n\nWe\u2019ve asked some visa application agencies about this but none of them have been able to give us a straight answer, so I would really appreciate any insights people here can provide. More general opinions/advice on our plan would also be appreciated!",

This is my last visa application for Leave to Remain, after which I'll be eligible to apply for British citizenship.   \nI'm currently on a spouse visa.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate some advice regarding the financial requirement, as our work situation has changed since my last application, for both myself and my husband.\n\n  \nAbout me:\n\nI work part-time and usually take on overtime, but recently there have been issues with overtime availability. I understand that I need to provide the last 6 months of payslips, but since my salary varies, I'm concerned that UKVI will calculate my annual salary based on the lowest payslip within that period.\n\nIf that's the case, my income might fall below the \u00a318,600 threshold (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong).\n\nIf my income alone isn\u2019t enough, I would like to combine it with my husband\u2019s income.   \nHowever, his situation is quite complex:\n\nHe works in an industry that has gone through major changes in recent years. He doesn't have a permanent contract like he used to, most of his work is on short-term contracts, lasting a month or two, sometimes only a few weeks, often with gaps in between.\n\nHi salary on this work varies from \u00a360-\u00a365k.   \nObviously he can provide all contracts and payslips, and based on our calculations, his annual income likely exceeds \u00a318,600, but it's spread across different employers throughout the year.\n\n\n\nMy first question is:\n\nAm I right in thinking that I can submit my 6 months of payslips and his 12 months of payslips from different employers, even though his work is not continuous? (the longest gap was 3-4 weeks)  \nOr do we both need to meet the financial requirement under the same evidence category?\n\nAdditionally:\n\nWe have a mortgage on a property we bought 2 years ago, would this be considered a helpful supporting factor?\n\nWe also have some savings, although they\u2019re under \u00a316,000, can this still help in any way?\n\nFinal question:\n\nGiven the instability in my husband\u2019s industry, would it be acceptable for him to include a cover letter explaining the situation and providing context? (strikes in the USA caused issues globally)  \nOr would that potentially harm the application?\n\nI would be really grateful for any advice or clarification, we just want to make sure we do everything right without having to make some sort of appeal.",

    "selftext": "Across the board, with a few exceptions, it seems that those who applied outside the UK for their spouse visa in June this year have suffered from a definite slowdown in the processing times.  UKVI have not to my knowledge admitted that things have slowed down or issued updated processing times, but the signals are definitely pointing that way.\n\nGiven that spouse/partner visas are processed in their Sheffield office, I am unsure if the summertime influx of student visas would be to blame, unless it's so acutely large this year that it is causing spillover into other offices/departments.\n\nChime in here to this weekly \"I'm still waiting\" thread with your location, biometrics date, and application type (e.g. priority vs. standard).\n\nWe applied **21st June**, from the **US**, paid **priority**, and did biometrics **26th June**.  We are still waiting and have received nothing - not even an ECO email.  Today is our 21st working day.  We have submitted two paid enquiries so far (one on 15th July and one on 25th July), and on both of them just received the standard \"your application is currently under consideration\" paragraph in reply.\n\nUKVI's public-facing processing time goal for priority applications is 30 working days.  Many earlier this year have received decisions in as little as 12 days.",

I also emailed my MP Wednesday and they contacted UKVI on Thursday to escalate. \n\nApplication Submitted: June 3\nBIO: June 9\nApplication received at NYC processing center (I was told by UKVI this is when your WD count begins): June 10\nECO: June 11\nAccepted: July 25 7:39 am CST local time\n",

However, VFS has not updated anything regarding the approval, and there is no information on when we will have her passport returned.   \n  \nMade a paid enquiry to UKVI but got a standard template response that does not even address the issue, VFS Lisbon does not have any phone number other than for Canadian applications (they refused to do anything since it was not a Canadian application), which is weird enough as it is.   \nMade a complaint to VFS via their feedback form, asking for an update, but still nothing. Is there a time within HAVE to return the passport to us within? Our visa process was already long, and now we are desperate to book flights, especially before they keep rising in price this August.   \nIf they don't say anything next week, who can I even complain or escalate this with if the UKVI paid enquiry just doesn't do anything?",

So, for example:\n\t\u2022\tPay period: 26 June \u2013 26 July\n\t\u2022\tPayment received: around 1 August\n\nNow I\u2019m confused because some say that will count as July pay (based on the payslip) and others say it counts as August income (based on the bank deposit date) which matters a lot when calculating the 6-month income window for the visa. Would it be better for me to ask the employer to pay me on the ACTUAL last day of the month or leave it as it is and clearly explain payroll timing on the application? Any advice will be appreciated.

According to the Home Office website I don't need a special visa or anything to marry in the UK because I'm already on a visa that lasts longer than 6 months. When I search how to proof my status the HO just directs me to create a share code. \n\nWill the registry office accept a share code as evidence?

We are currently planning to apply for our unmarried partner visa in October. \n\nNotes:   \nMy current visa: Youth Mobility Scheme 3 year (Australian national), expires end of November.   \nMy partner and I moved in together 11th October 2023.   \nOur lease is terminating on the 11th August 2025.   \nWe meet the financial requirements. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1) How difficult will it be for me to be approved for a rental with a share code that expires in November? \n\nWe have the option to stay with my partners parents for a few months, but this is over a 2h journey to both our workplaces. Doable, but not ideal.\n\n2) We can prove cohabitation from 11th of October (lease agreement), and have been together since May 2022. Will we need to provide proof of current address at the time of our application (i.e. if this is his parents and not a new lease)? \n\n3) We might be overseas from the 12th December. If we apply on the 11th October (2 years since we moved in together), are we likely to have the Visa approved before then? If not, should we consider applying earlier or avoid overseas travel? \n\n5) If we apply earlier, what is required to prove we have been in a committed relationship from May 2022?",

It changes the amount of payslips I need to attach, stretching from 6 to 12, which will include end of year bonuses as well.\n\nThanks in advance. ",

We had around 3 photos for each 6 months, spread evenly. Included photos of us with my family, at her sisters wedding, for christmas celebrations, etc.\n\nTo prove her knowledge of English: transcript from her masters degree in the UK. \n\nHope this helps anyone! \n\n",

She is Turkish with her Graduate visa expiring in November 2025.\n\nWe have been together since December 2022 when i was already working on a full time job and she was finishing her master.\n\nAfter she finished her master in end of August 2023 (which coincided with the end of her rental contract with her flatmate), she moved all her belongings to my flat share (with one other flatmate).\n\nFrom September 2023 to February 2025, she was in between Turkey, where she has been learning about her family business, and London where she was coming to visit and live with me for long periods. During that time, she was not on our tenancy agreement, and the only evidences of living together during that time are bank statements which were at the same address, and a testimony from our flatmate during that period.\n\nAfter going to Turkey together in October 2024 and having met all with all her relatives, her family got comfortable about us living together and accepted that we could move formally in a flat together. just the two of us.\n\nIn February 2025, we managed to find a place to move in together and this time we have all solid proofs showing that we are well living together (tenancy agreement, utility bills, etc...)\n\nWe plan to apply for the unmarried partner visa, on the following basis : - we have been in a serious relationship for more than 2 years and 8 months - we have not been able to live together just the two of us before February 2025 because her family was not comfortable with the idea, and she was in between Turkey and London during that period - as soon as we got the approval from her family about us moving together the two of us and settle in London. We went looking for a flat and acted the move in February 2025 - We now have all the evidences that we live together in London and have a similar lifestyle than a married couple\n\nWould you have a view on this application, and advice for it to be successfully approved ? If you believe that it will be rejected, could you please provide info on what's missing in our case ?\n\nThis is a very stressful time for us, and I saw how much this community was brought together around this topic \u2764\ufe0f\n\nMany thanks in advance for your help!",

    "selftext": "We applied for the spouse visa with me going ahead to the UK to secure a job, then applying for my husbands visa from US. I was very worried that it wouldn't get approved because my last US employer had financial difficulties and stopped paying me (I earned over that \u00a329k amount but didn't get paid it -  not my fault), so I was unable to prove I have over \u00a329k income for the last 6 months and also had no paystubs which are listed as mandatory. My new UK job is over that threshold but I had just started it a week earlier. I provided copies of correspondence with my former employer discussing them not paying me, a letter from them confirming the situation, and I included two years of bank statements and my paystubs for the previous year. I figured that if they took the last two years income and averaged it out then I'm over the \u00a329k each year so maybe that would be accepted. I also included my husbands paystubs and bank statements because even though its supposed to just be based on my income, since he works remote they coud at least see that extra income. No savings.\n\nI was expecting it to be rejected until I could prove 6 months in my new job at the required income, but it got approved. I'm so relieved and grateful. We have kids (all British citizens) and its so hard on them to have parents in separate countries.\n\nTimeline: Applied on May 26th. Husband couldn't do the biometrics appointment until June 6th due to his schedule. June 9th I got an email saying we have to upload all documents asap. Visa approved July 4th. We did pay extra for 30 working day processing.\n\nHope that info helps others going through this process!\n\n",

Our best guess is that since my income is as a sole trader working on a contractor basis, it takes a bit longer due to the extra financial evidence we provided, but 30 WD is a lot of time to hear nothing back at all, I feel.\n\nThe wait is torturous. So wondering who else might be waiting, as I see a lot of people are getting more recent approvals, even when other docs have been requested.\n\nEDIT: We received our Approval on Monday, now we are just waiting for VFS to return my wife passport.

The far biggest stressor was the Gibraltar marriage certificate- they took 7 weeks to send it to us (only the e-mail), then they made a minor clerical error on the signature line. We decided to still apply, since the full names were correct and they were also uncooperative with correcting it. So I\u2019d say THINK TWICE before getting married in Gibraltar.\n\nOn a personal note, this is the beginning of the end of the most hectic chapter in my life so far - unemployment, housing issues, juggling life in 3 countries, living out of a suitcase for 3 months etc. I\u2019m really grateful for my partner to have supported me through this, he\u2019s truly the best thing that has ever happened to me.

I know that we currently meet the requirement of living in the same district for 8+ days but, is that ever seen as negative by the registrar or Home Office (as far as I am aware it will be referred to the HO due to my status)?\n\n- We haven\u2019t picked a specific wedding date yet, just the venue due to potential 70 days clearance process by the HO - is that a problem at the notice appointment?\n\n- We\u2019re both working full-time on fixed-term contracts, my contract end date is the same as my residency expiry date (my salary is over the requirement, but we thought combining both incomes just in case) - any risks there from the Home Office\u2019s perspective?  \n\nWould really appreciate any thoughts, similar experiences, or advice you might have given the situation in general. \n\nWe\u2019re trying to do everything by the book and stay ahead of things, just a bit nervous about the timing around the notice and the application process.\n\nThanks so much and good luck to everyone!",

I work for extended periods in South Africa regularly. We first met online on a dating site in August 2024 and when I went to South Africa for work in October 2024 we met in person, we started dating and things went very very well. When I returned home we stayed in contact every day until I returned in March 2025. On my second visit she moved into the AirBnB I was renting with me and  In April 2025 we got legally married in South Africa and I have a unabridged marriage certificate from the south african home affairs. \n\nWe applied for 2 visitor visas whilst un married and both were refused, the first was down to travel history errors and financial issues due to not explaining her bank statements well enough we addressed the issues on the second attempt and it was refused due to her economic situation they did not believe she would return. I felt it a little unjust but it is what it is. \n\nWe are going through the application now and she is completing her A1 language test and her TB screening in South Africa this month. Once we have these we believe we will have enough to apply. I earn well in excess of \u00a329K and own a 4 bedroom house that only myself and my daughter live in. We have lots of photos together and thousands of call logs. I have a letter from my mother and a letter from her mother explaining they know of our relationship etc etc. I have done a relationship timeline and 2 separate letter one an invite and the other a detailed cover letter explaining everything. \nShe wants to complete her biometrics in Malawi this time so she can say good bye to her family etc. \n\nWhat are the benefits to a lawyer at this point and are tgere any good recommendations?",

We have received advice, but we\u2019d like to double-check it and ensure we don\u2019t miss anything important.\n\n\n\n*If you\u2019ve applied recently, we\u2019d appreciate it if you could provide information on the following:*\n\n* What documents were definitely required?\n* What\u2019s the best way to show your relationship is genuine?\n* Are there any documents it\u2019s better not to include?\n\n\n\n*Here\u2019s a list of what we\u2019ve been asked to provide so far:*\n\n* Marriage certificate (notarised and translated from Georgian)\n* A1 English language test certificate\n* TB test certificate\n* 40 photographs (not dated)\n* Passports for both of us \u2013 only international ones, with just the stamped/used pages\n* Letter from my husband\u2019s employer confirming job title, start date, and salary\n* My husband\u2019s payslips from February to July (6 months)\n* His bank statements for the same period \u2013 he\u2019ll get them from the bank on 1st August, but we\u2019re unsure if they need to be stamped and signed\n* Land registry document for his parents\u2019 UK property where we will reside (five-bedroom house)\n* Letter from my husband\u2019s parents (homeowners) confirming we can live there, with details of all current occupants and their consent\n* Recent council tax bill for the parents' house\n* Utility bills (water, gas, or electricity) from the last 3 months\n\n\n\n*And here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told* ***NOT*** *to include (but we\u2019re unsure about some of these):*\n\n* Dated photographs (I\u2019d still like to create a small photo album with captions and dates)\n* Screenshots of our messages or chats, even though they show regular contact\n* My birth certificate (but we\u2019re unsure if it should be included and/or translated)\n* Scans of every page of my international passport \u2013 only one page is used, the rest are blank due to my recent name change\n* I have a patronymic name which appears in Russian Cyrillic in my international passport. Should this be included as part of my given name on the UK spouse visa application?\n* Should I provide my internal passport (ID card) and Turkmenistan passport \u2013 do these need to be translated?\n* Photos of the house we\u2019ll live in (my in-laws' home)\n* A cover letter explaining our relationship\n\n\n\n***Any advice or clarification from those who\u2019ve gone through the process recently would be massively appreciated. We want to make sure we\u2019re submitting a strong and complete application, and that the advice we received is accurate. Thanks in advance!***\n\n",

She requires my care for extended periods of time every week, so my ability to work or earn money is also inhibited, therefore we want to apply for PIP and Universal credit. \n\nNow I already made a post about this on the UK Benefits help subreddit and the lovely redditors told me I may not be able to claim any public funds because of my VISA status, whereas some also told me that I may lose my VISA if we apply for the benefits such as Universal Credit.\n\nSo this is quite a worrying situation obviously, therefore I came to ask you all for your kind expert guidance.\n\nCan we claim PIP and Universal Credit while I'm on a Spouse Visa?

We\u2019ve been in a committed relationship for 3 years after meeting online, and we\u2019ve made sure to see each other twice a year\u2014whether in the UK, the Philippines, or during holidays abroad. I also visited the UK earlier this year on a tourist visa.\n\nWe\u2019re planning to apply for the UK fianc\u00e9 visa around June 2026, get married, and then switch to the spouse visa. Our main challenge is meeting the new \u00a329K financial requirement. My fianc\u00e9 earns about \u00a320K/year, so we\u2019re relying on a mix of his income and around \u00a345K in savings by the end of this year.\n\nThe complication is that \u00a320K of those savings was a gift from a family friend in May 2025. Since UKVI usually requires 6 months of bank statements, the gift may not appear by the time we apply.\n\nWe\u2019d really appreciate any advice or insight on the following:\n\n1. Has anyone here used gifted money for the savings route? Was it accepted?\n\n2. What\u2019s the best way to prove it\u2019s a genuine gift, not a loan? (We can provide a signed letter from the person who gave it.)\n\n3. We submitted my fianc\u00e9\u2019s bank statements in Feb 2025 for my tourist visa\u2014could UKVI compare those and question the sudden increase in savings?\n\nWe\u2019re doing our best to prepare everything honestly and clearly, and would be so grateful for any advice or shared experiences.\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

I can provide call history, chat screenshots, photos (w/ dates), wedding venue information & receipts, ring purchase receipts, fight details of when we visited each other, Airbnbs in which we stayed together, social media posts, etc. Do you think this would be enough to prove our ongoing relationship?

Unfortunately my fianc\u00e9 and I don\u2019t meet the financial requirement for the 5-year route, and I\u2019m really nervous about it.\n\nHere\u2019s my situation:\n\nI\u2019m a 20-year-old German citizen, and my fianc\u00e9 is British. We met through the internet and  we\u2019ve been in a committed long-distance relationship since October 2019, and we first met in person in September 2021 (after COVID made meeting impossible).\n\nWe\u2019ve been seeing each other regularly \u2014 every 2\u20133 months \u2014 for the past 3+ years.\nWe\u2019ve never lived together due to financial limits and visa barriers and education,but we have a long, stable, loving relationship and we\u2019re engaged now.\nHe earns about \u00a322,000/year pre-tax, so we don\u2019t meet the \u00a329k requirement for the 5-year spouse visa.\nI can\u2019t really say I\u2019m planning to apply under the 10-year route but we feel so lost because every immigration solicitor says something different. One says that I will have the 10 year route and argue that forcing us to live apart or relocate to Germany would breach our human rights (Article 8 ECHR). And one says because I\u2019m an EU citizen there\u2019s a visa for me to work for 6 months in the uk to have our income combined to meet the financial requirements.\n\nHere's the emotional and personal context:\nI cannot live in Germany safely anymore. I currently live in Germany tho.\nMy mother has schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (very severe) and struggles with addiction issues like compulsive shopping.\nMy father is the sole carer for my uncle, who has ALS. He can\u2019t support me.\nI have no emotional support network in Germany, only trauma. Being forced to stay there would severely damage my mental health.\nMy fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t move to Germany \u2014 he doesn\u2019t speak the language and would lose his job, his family can\u2019t relocate due to health issues.\nWe\u2019ve done our best to hold the relationship together long-distance, but it\u2019s draining and heartbreaking.\nI\u2019m a qualified early childhood educator (Erzieherin) and passed the B1 English test with Merit. I want to live, work, and build my life in the UK.\nWhat I\u2019m afraid of:\nWe were told that many 10-year route applications get refused, especially if there\u2019s no cohabitation. That terrifies me.\nWe\u2019re working hard to build a strong application with letters, evidence, and a human rights statement, but we\u2019re not sure how the Home Office will see our case.\n\nQuestions:\nHas anyone successfully applied under the 10-year Unmarried Partner route without living together?\nHow much evidence do we need to prove emotional/mental hardship?\nShould we try to marry first and apply as a spouse instead \u2014 even if we still don\u2019t meet the \u00a329k?\nIs there any way I could come to the UK to work legally for 6 months and then combine our incomes?\nAny advice, support, or real-life stories would mean so much. This is overwhelming, and we just want a chance to finally live together.\n\nThank you in advance. \ud83d\ude4f\n\n",

(I looked into it, German paid job won\u2019t count.

Is the fact that we HAVE lived together for 2 years at some point enough? \n\nHe has to apply for the visa within Germany and so he can\u2019t be with me in England at the time of the application. \n\nIf you need any clarification to assist me please ask in the comments, I\u2019m at my whits end with this visa shit and just want to be able to go back to England with my husband.\n\nAny advice is appreciated ",

    "selftext": "BRA \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 & BRI \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 SPOUSE VISA APPROVED (PRIORITY)\n\nHi guys, I am happy to be posting my key timelines here as I know this will help, encourage and calm others down who are waiting for a successful application. I applied for Spouse Visa outside the UK (From Brasilia - Brazil) using the priority service. We are a gay couple and I\u2019m Brazilian and my husband British. We are both seafarers working on \ud83d\udea2 around the globe. \ud83c\udf0e. As we both work at sea, we used our savings to meet the financial threshold (\u00a388.500). \n\n\u2022\tMarriage: 25 April Gibraltar \n\n\u2022\tSolicitor: Yes (First Migration based in London) \u00a31400 fee\n\n\u2022\tApplication submitted: 13th June \n\n\u2022\tBiometrics: 18th June\n\n\u2022\tECO email: 20th June \n\n\u2022\tSuccessful email: 9th July @ 10:07 am\n\n\u2022\tVFS Global: Passport yet to be received from Brasilia VSF\n\n\n\nJust waiting for the passport to be returned by courier! It worked out perfectly as I have a flexible ticket booked for mid-July and I had set the entry for 25th July 2025 on my application. \n\nBACKGROUND: I had previously lived in the UK (for over 12 years) and submitted in Dec 2016 an application for leave to remain (ILR) which was refused in Apr 2017 as I had spent over 180 days outside the UK during this time.\n\nLong story short, after the refusal I left the country voluntarily and returned to Brazil and started working on ships around the globe. During my time at sea, I met my husband and got married earlier this year. We used a well known solicitor in London who helped us immensely to gather all the necessary docs to submit our application. It is an expensive process (\u00a31400 solicitor fee alone) and since I have lived in UK before and had a visa application refused, I thought it would be best to seek professional advice prior to submit my application. Very pleased I did so as it puts your mind to rest. \n\nI hope those who are waiting get their successful decision soon.\u00a0God\u00a0bless.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI\u2019m looking for some advice or experiences regarding the UK spouse visa process.\n\nI\u2019m a Polish citizen with settled status in the UK (living here since 2008) and currently earning \u00a333,000, with potential to increase to \u00a340,000 within the same company. My partner is Mexican, we met in London during her stay here, and I\u2019ve recently visited her in Mexico. She\u2019s now about to start a new job in Lisbon.\n\nOur goal is to eventually settle in the UK together, ideally starting the process next year. From what I understand, as she\u2019s a non-EU citizen, the most realistic path forward is through the UK spouse visa. We're planning to do a civil marriage in Poland, then apply for the visa.\n\nCurrently, I live with family in the UK, but I'm working towards securing a rented flat of our own. I read that you need to demonstrate you can afford rent or show intent to live together  is this true? Would living with family temporarily (as a backup) be considered acceptable if we clearly intend to find our own place?\n\nAlso:\n\nOnce she\u2019s in the UK on the spouse visa, would I still need to maintain the \u00a329k income level to extend it after 2.5 years?\n\nIs it worth hiring a solicitor to guide us through the application? We\u2019re prepared to be very thorough and start saving now.\n\n\nAny advice from someone who went through a similar path would be hugely appreciated \u2014 especially if you were also from the EU with a non-EU partner.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

First and foremost I have to thank this amazing community and top contributors. You guys are amazing \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd, whenever I had doubts or questions (however stupid they are), I've always got my answers and assurance here so I would like to give back to the community by sharing the details of my application and timeline.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nEnd of May: English test at LanguageCert. Got official result within 3 days (email) and a week (letter).\n\nMid June-1 July: Collect all supporting documents, especially bank statements.\n\n2 July: Application submitted to UKVI and, after paying IHS surcharge and visa fee, immediately got a slot for biometrics appointment in Bristol TLScontact (I submitted at 11am on a Wednesday) for 8 July. I opted in for uploading supporting documents myself, which needs to be completed before appointment.\n\n7 July: Submitted all supporting documents through TLS website (details below).\n\n8 July:\n\n* Appointment at 9AM, finished by 9.20AM. They only need to see my valid passport. I went overboard by printing everything I had uploaded which was NOT needed at all.\n* 10AM received TLS confirmation email that biometric collection is confirmed.\n* 11.43AM received an email from Home Office that application is successful!\n\n**Supporting documents**\n\n1. Application housekeeping: a) Document checklist provided by UKVI at the end of application - filled with checkmarks, b) application form, c) appointment confirmation.\n2. Cover letter: Only signed by myself. I wrote this mainly to help whoever assessed my application going through the documents in a much more systematic way. This might be (part of) the reason why the decision came really fast. Example paragraph is below and at the end of the letter I listed all the supporting documents, and when uploading, I named it as it was written on the cover letter.\n\n*I am writing to submit my application for a Family Visa as a spouse to my husband, \\[his name\\]. I am currently enrolled as a student at the \\[university name\\] and am residing in the UK on a Student Visa (Appendix 1). My husband is a British citizen (Appendix 3) and we met at the university in September 20XX. Our relationship began in October 20XX, and we moved in together in student accommodation in August 20XX (Appendix 4 and 5). He proposed to me in August 20XX and we were married on \\[date of marriage\\] (Appendix 6). \\[...\\]*\n\n*End of letter:*  \n*Appendix 1. \\[my name\\] valid passport and old BRP.*  \n*Appendix 2. Declaration and consent pages signed by \\[my name and my husband's name\\]*  \n*Appendix 3. \\[my husband name\\] valid passport.*  \n*Appendix 4. Council tax 20XX-20XX in \\[city name\\].*  \n*Appendix 5. Tenancy agreement 20XX-20XX in \\[city name\\].*  \n*Appendix 6. Marriage certificate*  \n*\\[...\\]*\n\n3. Declaration and consent pages from UKVI, **ink-signed and scanned**.  \n4. Proof of accommodation in the past 2 years: a) council tax, b) tenancy agreement, and c) letter from landlord. I understand this was less of a concern since we are married so I was not too thorough.  \n5. Proof of current accommodation: a) council tax, b) bank statement, c) electricity and gas bill, d) home insurance policy; all of which had both our names.  \n6. Proof of intention to live together: As we are very fortunate to jointly own a place, and this just came through recently, we provided a) dated and signed TR1 forms and b) completion statement from our conveyencer to prove that we own the property.  \n7. Marriage certificate.  \n8. Bank statements for all cash savings and declaration of sources of the cash savings. Declarations were all ink-signed and scanned. We used 3 cash savings: 2 were under my husband's name, 1 was jointly owned. One of the cash savings was an ISA.  \n9. English test result.  \n10. Other proof of relationship: 10 photographs of me and my husband, with friends and family, throughout the relationship.\n\nHope this information helps everyone who's planning to apply or in the process of applying and I am happy to give further details and answer any questions (if I know the answer)! The process **is stressful** but hang in there, if you carefully follow the requirements and allow enough time to prepare, it will all be fine.",

    "selftext": "Hi lovely community,\n\nhave been a passive reader for a while but will soon begin the application for the spouse visa. I have searched the forum, looked at checklists provided and looked at the official guidance from gov.uk. Out of an abundance of caution and to ease my mind, I wanted to ask if I have understood everything correctly. \n\nFirst of all, some background information:\n\n* I (applicant) am a Swedish national currently living in Germany\n* My partner (sponsor) is a UK national. She is self-employed, meets the financial requirement, and is a homeowner.\n* We have been together for almost 3 years, but have not lived together since our visas don't allow us to live together (brexit)\n\nHere are the documents we plan to provide:\n\n* Passport copy applicant\n* Passport copy sponsor\n* Relationship evidence\n   * Personal statements from both partners\n   * Screenshots of messaging from throughout the years\n   * Call logs \n   * Photos from througout the years, from trips and with family\n   * Travel history (airplane and hotel bookings)\n   * Letters from family members (sponsor's older brother, applicant's mother)\n* Justification of not living together (written explanation)\n* Financial proof (provided by sponsor)\n   * 12 months bank statmeents (self employed partner)\n   * SA302 tax return\n   * Invoices from previous months\n   * Letter from accountant\n   * Bank Statement\n* Accommodation\n   * Morgage statement\n   * Council Tax\n   * Letter of intent to live together\n* Language: SELT certificate (A1) of applicant\n\n  \nA few questions:\n\n* There are very few appointments for the language certificate in Germany. Can I take the langague test in the UK while visiting on a tourist visa? The [official guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prove-your-english-language-abilities-with-a-secure-english-language-test-selt?utm_source=chatgpt.com) are not clear on this. \n* Am I missing anything? I realise the regulations of applying as an umarried partner without cohabitation are new, but perhaps someone has gone through the process.\n\n  \nThank you so much!! ",

I have some questions, it would be great if you guys can answer.\n\n1- She is a partner with her Father in Self Employment. The business account is in her Father's name since it is a Newspaper distribution business with majority of customers from older generations and they usually write checques or pay in cash. So it is difficult to change the bank account for that matter. We are planning to write this in her personal statement and the accountant's letter. She did receive around 10 K from her father in her personal bank account in relevant tax year. Rest of the income is in form of cash and would be confirmed through her self- tax assesment and a letter from accountant confirming so. I want to know if this arrangement could work.\n\n2- We are going to combine her Self Employment income with Non- Salaried employment income. Should we do it under Category F or if anyother category would be suitable.\n\n3- Based on above information what evidence documents we need for her self employment.\n\nI would be grateful, if you can answer these questions. \n",

I have so much confusion on choosing either PSW(graduate route) or go for a dependent visa(family visa). I want to do what\u2019s best for our future here \u2014 for my career, for our family\u2019s settlement, and for our child\u2019s stability.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar \u2014 international students becoming parents, switching to dependent visas, juggling PSW vs family routes \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear your story. Anything that helped you make sense of it all.\n\nThanks for reading \ud83d\udc9b\n",

Following this, he has been on a graduate visa since May 2024, due to expire in May 2026. \n\nWe\u2019re from a religious background so living together isn\u2019t an option for us, but we are prepared to marry soon if he is not able to find visa sponsorship through employment.\n\nWe were thinking of marrying in January 2026 and applying for the visa after that. My questions are:\n\n- Will the fact that we are marrying after 10 months fail to prove that the relationship is genuine? What evidence is needed to support this? \n\n- We were also thinking of eloping and just having our parents at the ceremony, with a view to having a wider celebration following the visa application. Again, would this cause UKVI to view the wedding as a sham? \n\nJust to be clear, this is an 100% genuine relationship and not someone trying to pull the wool over my eyes! We\u2019ve met friends and family and are continuing to do so at this stage, as well as enjoying being together! ",

    "selftext": "\ud83d\udcc5\u00a0**TIMELINE**:\n\n* **18 May 2025**\u00a0\u2013 Submitted the online application and opted for priority service when booking biometrics.\n* **24 May 2025**\u00a0\u2013 Biometrics appointment. They refused to sign the document checklist (didn't affect my application), but they DID sign and stamp the biometrics appointment confirmation.\n* **24 May 2025**\u00a0\u2013 Mailed my passport + documents to VFS. I included:\n   * Printed application\n   * Passport\n   * Document checklist (signed only by me)\n   * Biometrics appointment confirmation page\n   * UPS Shipping label\n* **27 May 2025**\u00a0\u2013 Documents received in New York. Got email confirmations from both VFS and UPS.\n* **19 June 2025**\u00a0\u2013 ECO (Entry Clearance Officer) email. It was generic, kind of vague. But if you uploaded your documents online, it just means wait it out.\n* **23 June 2025**\u00a0\u2013 Got the success email \u2013 I'd been granted entry clearance!\n* **24 June 2025**\u00a0\u2013 Received my passport + vignette via UPS.\n* **29 June 2025**\u00a0\u2013 Vignette start date (same date I listed as my intended UK arrival). Not sure if this helped my case go faster, but worth mentioning.\n\n**\ud83d\udccc PROCESSING TIME**:\n\n* So from biometrics on\u00a0**24th May**\u00a0and receiving my passport on\u00a0**24th June**\u2014that\u2019s\u00a0**23 business days**\u00a0total, not including weekends. Honestly smoother than I expected!\n\n**\ud83c\udf0d BACKGROUND**:\n\n* As a U.S. citizen, I had to return home to apply for the UK spouse visa, since you must apply from a country where you have legal residency.\n* We got married in the U.S. a year prior\u2014it was faster, cheaper, and easier than doing it in the UK. Plus, the marriage certificate became the \"holy grail\" of our relationship evidence.\n\n\ud83d\udca1\u00a0**KEY TIPS + THINGS I LEARNED**:\n\n* **Payment issues?**\u00a0Our cards kept getting declined when paying the IHS and visa fee. **PayPal** worked instantly.\n* **Courier submission return**\u00a0just means VFS sends you two UPS shipping labels via email. One goes on your envelope, one goes in with your paperwork. We misunderstood this at first.\n* Sign up for the\u00a0**UPS notification service**\u2014super helpful in tracking our packages along the way.\n* If you want\u00a0**priority**, do not click on the Bronze Package when choosing services. Skip all extras and continue to booking biometrics on the VFS website and select **USCIS**. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll see the actual speed options.\n\n\ud83d\udcc2\u00a0**SELF-UPLOADED DOCUMENTS I INCLUDED (AND HOW I ORGANIZED THEM)**:\n\nI might\u2019ve gone a little overboard, but I didn\u2019t get asked for anything else, so I guess it worked out! I grouped docs by category into clearly named PDFs (ex. \u201cMarriageCertificate.pdf\u201d). Here's what I included and the sections I put them under:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\u00a0**Proof of Application**\n\n* Ticked and signed document checklist\n* Confirmation of my biometrics appointment\n* Photos of every single page of my passport\u2014yes, even the blank ones\n* PDF of my visa application (not sure if it was needed but I added it anyway)\n\n\ud83d\udcbc\u00a0**Sponsor\u2019s Employment**\n\n* My husband\u2019s cover letter\u2014explaining our relationship and how long we\u2019ve been together\n* His employment and salary history\n* His P60\n* A copy of his passport (ID page only)\n* A letter from his employer confirming his job and salary\n* His work contract showing responsibilities\n\n\ud83c\udfe0\u00a0**Accommodation**\n\n* A house survey he had done a while ago\n* House deed\n* Survey checklist confirming the place is liveable\n* Mortgage letter\n* Mortgage valuation report\n* His own letter saying I can live with him now and always\n\n\ud83c\udf93\u00a0**Education**\n\n* My bachelor\u2019s degree and university transcript\n* His bachelor\u2019s degree\n\n**\ud83d\udcb0 Financial Evidence**\n\n* Screenshots of my husband\u2019s bank statements compiled into a PDF\n* His wage slips\u2014same idea, all in one PDF\n\n**\u2764\ufe0f Relationship & Life Events**\n\n* Facebook posts from our families showing us together\n* Our marriage certificate\n* Random, everyday messages between visits\u2014nothing sappy, just regular convos\n* My birth certificate\n* PDFs of all my flight confirmations and boarding passes to the UK, plus short summaries of each visit\n* 11 relationship photos from over the years (roughly 2 per year) with dates and short descriptions\n* My husband\u2019s birth certificate\n* Husband\u2019s boarding passes (formatted the same way as mine)\n\n\ud83d\udccc\u00a0**Other**\n\n* My personal cover letter\u2014explaining what I uploaded and a bit about our relationship\n* My California state ID\n* My husband\u2019s UK driving licence\n\n**\ud83d\udcad FINAL THOUGHTS**:\n\nDon\u2019t panic if something doesn\u2019t go perfectly (like that unsigned checklist)\u2014the process allows a little wiggle room. Just stay organized, stay calm, and screenshot everything.\n\nSpecial thanks to this subreddit I was quietly stalking this place daily for tips, reassurance, and success stories. Honestly, it got me through some of the most anxiety-filled moments of the process. Every post, comment, and spreadsheet shared here gave me a little more confidence \u2014 so this is my way of giving back.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this while frantically Googling or refreshing your email\u2026 I see you. You\u2019ve got this. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or need help with anything\u2014happy to share more if I can!\n\n**\u270f\ufe0f Edit:** Just to clarify\u2014I didn\u2019t use a lawyer for my visa. I handled the whole process myself after researching a bunch of resources online. Took some time, but it was manageable!",

HO curtailed my leave and I was ready to leave the UK but due to some political reasons I have to file asylum. I applied for asylum before my L2R was expired.\n\nThen, I found my current partner who is a British citizen and we were in genuine relationship. We moved in together 2024 and started living together.\nWe then formed CP in 2025. Luckily, my notice period wasn\u2019t extended to 70days. I received a letter from HO telling that they arent doing a investigation.\nAfter that, I did my English test and applied for FLR M. I contacted alot of solicitors but no one were ready to take my case but I went through this reddit and did all by myself.I withdrew my asylum application after applying for FLR M.\nMy timeline are as follows:\n\nVisa Application: 22 May 2025\nBiometric: 29 May 2025\nHO Email about receiving of documents:30 May\nAdditional Documents Email:27 June\nApplication successful Email:29 June (1month)\n\nSo Goodluck everyone. As long as your relationship is genuine and you can prove it,you dont have to worry. All the solicitor I contacted told me that I need to leave the UK and apply from outside. But I trusted my guts and trusted on myself because my relationship was genuine.",

We\u2019ve been together for four years in total, two of those years were effectively long distance until I moved to the UK for my masters degree in September 2022, and then started my job which currently sponsors me in September 2023. We have been continuously together but opted not to live together for a number of reasons:\n\n1). Shortly after I arrived in the UK, he moved abroad for a work secondment for 6 months \n\n2). I was on a student visa for the first year I was here and did not have a guaranteed right to stay in the UK until I passed the probation for my current job in December of 2023. Even thereafter, having not worked for a full two years at my current role leaves me vulnerable to immediate redundancies and lay-offs with no recourse- I would not have wanted him to be in a position where he is liable to pay full rent for the two of us if I am suddenly unable to live/work in the UK (which happened to a former colleague of mine recently)\n\n3). We both thought it was better for my ability to live here long term for us to live separately while I got accustomed to living in London and making sure I had my own social life and friends. \n\nWe\u2019re engaged, we\u2019ve moved in together as of May 2025, we both earn well above the financial requirement, we have plenty of evidence of our relationship being genuine etc. I\u2019m just worried about this two year cohabitation rule? Will it help that we now live together? I appreciate it is a risk no matter what but would be grateful if someone could weigh in on the legitimacy of the reasons I\u2019ve enumerated above. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! Just wanted to share some good news and my timeline in case it helps anyone currently going through the UK spouse visa process.\n\n**Type:** Spouse Visa \u2013 In-Country Standard Route  \n**Submitted:** May 26, 2025  \n**ECO Email (Your application has been passed to a decision maker):** June 6, 2025  \n**Approval Email Received:** June 30, 2025 \ud83c\udf89\n\nThat\u2019s just over a month from submission to approval. I honestly thought it would take longer, so getting the decision today was such a relief!\n\nLike many of you, I\u2019ve been refreshing my email *constantly* multiple times a day, every day hoping for any update. And of course, the one day I wasn\u2019t obsessively checking it, I sat down at my work station with my laptop and *boom*, there it was: a notification from the Home Office. I opened it immediately, heart racing and it was the APPROVAL email!\n\nI didn\u2019t pay for super priority or priority services, just the standard route. If you\u2019re still waiting, I know how stressful it is, but hang in there. It *will* come through.\n\nWishing everyone the best and happy to answer questions if anyone\u2019s curious about the process!",

It also treats the child as a financial dependent \u2014 for example, on the sponsor\u2019s side, it asks how much money is given to support the child.\n\nHow should I answer these questions correctly to show that we have a British child, but he is not a dependent for the purposes of the application?\n",

My boyfriend is scottish and an accountant we have been together for almost 3yrs now. On date 1 we talked about life, expectations and plans for future and been so open. We left feeling we are perfect for each other. I love him to bits. Theres no words to express it. And I am 1000% sure he feels the same cuz he makes me feel it. He has been crying his heart out since I lost my job due to redundancy and received my 60day curtailment letter. We are both shattered and struggling to figure out what to do. \n\nWe have spoken in lengths about getting married to each other and his whole family loves us together and keep referring to me as their daughter in law already and make me feel like I\u2019m a part of their family. Absolutely adore them. Same goes for my parents. They cannot speak fluent english but can hold a conversation and absolutely adore him and how he treats me. His mum has told me before I even got a letter that he has some surprise for me and I had seen a ring in the wardrobe before I even lost my job. We always had a plan to get married by next year this time anyway. \n\nHis family and him have been discussing with me to give the unmarried partner visa, spouse visa, fiance visa a thought and asking me to stop looking for and forget getting a sponsored job again because we might have to do this \u2018couples visa\u2019 in a years time or so anyway. We have elaborate plans on how we want to get married so we thought we will take our time to build our finances and plan the wedding and for the fiance visa I need to leave the country first which and can\u2019t work when on it so it might impact my future potential jobs due to gaps, so we wanted to see if we can apply for unmarried partner visa. \n\nWE ARE NOT TRYING TO CHEAT OR WORK THE SYSTEM, we\u2019re genuinely in love with each other and cannot imagine our lives without one another so please don\u2019t look at us that way.  We meet all requirements of finances, relationship time, etc but \u2026.\n\nOUR ISSUE IS:\n\n- We haven\u2019t lived together for 2yrs since I had my own rented space and my parents weren\u2019t comfortable about me live-in situation but they came around after knowing him. \n- He bought a house and was doing it up so lived with his mum at the time. \n\nWe are speaking to lawyers to help out with this but our earliest appointment is not until wednesday and I\u2019m freaking out. \n\nCan you guys please help us out if you have any idea? Thank you in advance \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ",

Additionally, she is a recipient of PIP.\nAt the moment, I am unemployed, since there is serious discrimination against job security for blind persons in Trinidad and Tobago.\nMy source of income comes from disability payments from my government. she is able to provide bank statements and pay Slips and can provide a job letter demonstrating her employment, history and current financial standing.\nShe is the owner of a bungalow that is suitable for both of us to live comfortably and healthily.\nShe has visited me twice at my home country twice. Once, for the first time we met in person and the second time, to spend my birthday with me.\nI visited her twice in the UK. The first visit, after her first trip to Trinidad and Tobago and my second visit, after her trip to spend my birthday with me. \n\nWe met on a Facebook messenger group for blind musicians in 2020. We were unable to meet each other in person before 2022, since there were strict rules governing my ability to leave the country and her ability to enter my country. At the time entry to my country was completely off the table unless extreme circumstances. \nFrom November 2020 to the present day, our relationship has been via WhatsApp calls and text, messenger calls and text and FaceTime.\n Her first trip to see me was November 2022. My first trip to see her was June 2023.\nHer next trip to see me was February 20 24 and my next trip to see her was September 2024.\n In April 2025, she came to Trinidad and Tobago where we got married.\nI have all the calls and messages for the five years of our communication on WhatsApp. We have E tickets for all of the flights her and I took too see each other and the trip that her and some of her family members took to Trinidad and Tobago for the wedding.\nWe have photos from each of the trips, showing us together and spending time with her and my family.\nWe have loads of wedding photos and an engagement photo.\nBoth our passports are valid. We have no criminal history or immigration violations.\nAs far as immigration goes, I recently applied for a visitors, visa to spend some time with her, but was rejected. Not understanding the form correctly, I feel to prove where the source of the money in my bank account came from.\nI mentioned that I was going to see my wife, but did not provide excerpts from the WhatsApp chat. Neither did I have a marriage certificate at the time. I now have documentation proving my source of funds, our marriage certificate, and proof of our communication and travel history to see each other. We have scanned pages of our passports, where we took the flights mentioned to see each other. What more do we need? The work to prepare and getting everything ready is not an issue for me. I just want to know that we\u2019re doing this properly. We\u2019ve even elected to go for an immigration solicitor. Whilst yes, the solicitor is being paid to assist us with everything, I want to approach this venture with the necessary knowledge required to do this properly so that I can be fully informed, understand what\u2019s happening and be able to contribute in a useful manner to this endeavor\nThanks guys ",

I noticed that I created an account and applied with one email, but the approval decision from UKVI came to a secondary email address I provided. Regardless, it\u2019s the same application number, so just wondering how long it took VFS to acknowledge your approval and get your passport sent back to you? I\u2019d really like to travel out of the country next week but can\u2019t because they still have my passport.\n\n\nUpdate: I received 6 emails this morning from UKVI to attend my biometrics appointment. I did so on 8 May and sent my passports to the VFS processing center. WHAT DO I DO?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit/ I\u2019ve contacted UKVI to submit an official enquiry to VFS for the status of my documents since it\u2019s been more than 10 working days. The number is +44 300 790 6268 and costs \u00a30.60 per minute. There is also a form you can submit online I think? The only information they gave me is that VFS has 15 WD to reply to the enquiry before I can escalate. I travel in 5 weeks so hoping this is the push VFS needs to return my docs. I\u2019ve contacted them twice with no response from them. \n\nEdit// Nearly a full working week after calling UKVI on the status of my documentation, my passports have FINALLY been dispatched from VFS. 3 full weeks since my decision was made. This feels MUCH longer than normal so I recommend to reach out to UKVI if it\u2019s been more than 10 working days. ",

I'm having second thoughts and feeling very stuck.\n\nMy father, myself (I was 16 at the time), my brother (11), and my sister (2) came to the UK in 2016 after my mother applied for dependent visas for us. My mother has been in UK for 10 consecutive years now which she has currently in a ILR settlement visa.\n\nFast forward to now \u2014 my father and brother both had their ILR applications refused. However, my dad was offered a refund if he applies to extend his family visa within 10 working days. My brother was advised to pay the IHS fee to switch to the private life route, and he still has valid leave to remain until 3rd November.\n\nMy sister, now 12, hasn\u2019t received a decision yet.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m 25 years old and I just got married 2 months ago to a British citizen. I applied for ILR under the child dependent route (SET(F)) on 29 October 2024, before my visa expired on 30 November 2024. I\u2019ve been asked several questions during the process \u2014 including about when my fianc\u00e9 (now husband) and I were getting married, etc. But I still haven\u2019t received a decision.\n\nI spoke with an immigration advisor who suggested I apply for a spouse visa now, before I get  an official refusal \u2014 which I think might be coming. But I\u2019m also worried because the ILR application was expensive and I don\u2019t think the Home Office will refund me if I withdraw or apply for a different visa now.\n\nSo I\u2019m torn:\n\nShould I wait for the decision (even if it's likely to be unsuccessful) and see if the Home Office offers any refund or guidance, like they did with my dad? Or should I apply for a spouse visa now, even if I lose the money I already paid for the ILR application? This whole situation is really draining me \u2014 it's constantly on my mind, and I feel completely stuck.\n\nAlso, my father and brother still have the right to work until they apply for what the Home Office has advised them to do. But I want to ask \u2014 would I lose my right to work if I receive an unsuccessful decision letter? I can\u2019t lose my job as direct debits are continuous and the cost of living especially in UK is high and I can\u2019t lose my job.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any advice or suggestions.",

    "selftext": "First things first, I genuinely believe that this could not have been done without help of all of the contributors in this community, so I want to give a **HUGEEE THANK YOU** to those who answered questions, those who shared their journeys and even those who are simply asking the questions. Every interaction has been beneficial.\n\nWhen we started this journey, we had no idea where to go, who to ask or even what to do. All we knew was that there was a process - A process we was not familiar with.\n\nWe initially started trawling through Appendix FM and the Immigration Rules and honestly... It did more harm than good. It confused us, it made us start to worry, at this point, we were considering getting a solicitor. After googling a few solicitors and researching the task at hand, I miraculously ended up in r/SpouseVisaUk.\n\nAfter a few days of reading hundreds and hundreds of posts, our confidence grew, we began understanding what we failed to understand before. This community helped us become proficient at understanding what was required of us and how to present our evidence.\n\nWe decided not get a solicitor in the end because we began to have so much faith in ourselves, it didn't feel right to hand over this responsibility to anyone else. We thought that if anyone was going to take great care and evaluate every little detail in the application, it would be us, the Applicant and the Spouse.\n\nAnd so we jumped straight in, into the deep end, with ourselves and just this amazing community to look towards for help \ud83d\ude05\n\nHere is our timeline:\n\nAPPLICATION DATE - 14th May 2025  \nBIOMETRICS DATE VIA VFSGLOBAL SYLHET - 18th May 2025  \nECO EMAIL - 23rd May 2025  \n<We did not receive any Automatic Updates>  \nAPPROVAL EMAIL - 25th June 2025 @ 16:07 BST  \nPASSPORT READY FOR COLLECTION - 1st July 2025  \nPASSPORT COLLECTED - 2nd July 2025  \n(Vignette Inside with 3 Months Validity for Entry Clearance)\n\nWe received a decision in line with what is expected to be 75% of applicants as shown in u/Ravendorr's post on Percentile Data of Application Decisions.\n\n22 Working Days from ECO | 27 Working Days from BIO\n\n33 Total Days from ECO | 38 Total Days from BIO\n\nWe provided the following evidence:\n\n**CORE DOCUMENTATION**\n\nAPPLICANTS' PASSPORT - We started panicking as we only uploaded the Bio and Data pages and nothing else. We had seen people had stated they uploaded Blank Pages of their passport after we had already submitted ours. At this point, we just thought if they need it, they may ask for it. There isn't anything of importance in blank pages but this had us panicking for 2 or 3 days before we just came to terms with it. We actually forgot about this blunder again when the ECO email came asking that if there was anything else we should provide, we would have 5 days to do it in. This didn't even cross my mind when ECO came. Now that we received approval, I think of my initial thought of \"why do they need blank pages uploaded\". Maybe they don't, who knows...\n\nSPOUSE'S PASSPORT - This was straightforward, British Passport Bio Page and Data Page\n\nAPPROVED ENGLISH SPEAKING TEST RESULTS - We provided an IELTS A1 Life Skills Test Result Form which had the UKVI Number on it.\n\nPRE-DEPARTURE TB MEDICAL EXAMINATION CERTIFICATE - Another straightforward piece of paperwork, all applicant did was attend an IOM facility for medical screening in Sylhet and then picked up the results a few days later.\n\n**FINANCIAL**\n\n12 MONTHS PAYSLIPS - We applied under Category A however Spouse had fluctuating Gross Pay amounts due to overtime and bonus payments. We incorrectly selected \"Not the same amount continuously, above the financial requirement amount\". After submission, we realised that maybe we could have selected \"The same amount continuously, above the financial requirement amount\" option. In reality, Spouse did have the same (fixed) salary amount each month (if you don't include the overtime and bonus) but when we was applying, we chose the most appropriate answer, or what we both thought to have been the 'correct' answer. When selecting this option, I think the application assumes Cat B, therefore we were requested to provide 12 months payslips which we did not mind providing. We made it extremely clear in our cover letter exactly which category we were intending to apply under as to not cause any confusion on the Decision Makers' end.\n\n12 MONTHS BANK STATEMENTS - We provided 12 months Bank Statements, with Digital 'True Copy' Certifications on every page from Spouse's bank. We aren't sure if this is mandatory or not, but we didn't want to take any chances and the Bank provides this service free of charge for Spouse... So why would we not. Again, we gave 12 months as requested, presumably so that they can match it with the Payslip Net Pay amounts each month. No issues there from our end other than maybe feeling we were doing too much. Spouse had a LOOOT of pages for 12 months so it felt excessive at the time as we were thinking they only need 6 months.\n\nCONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT\n\nCONFIRMATION OF EMPLOYMENT ON OFFICIAL LETTERHEADED PAPERWORK - Had to get this from HR at Spouse's workplace. We initially gave them a list of requirements for the letter... However what we got in the end was actually super basic. It was literally a letter stating Job Role, Salary, Type of Contract (Perm) and Employment Start Date. This had us a little worried and when Spouse went back to HR, he was told that the company's policy is to ONLY provide the information they had already given us, nothing more and nothing less. We accepted that this was the best we was going to get and didn't dwell too much on this as we knew employment would likely be verified via HMRC along with the payslips.\n\nP60 - Again, I think this was triggered by the incorrect Cat B assumption from the weirdly worded question we all know. Provided it anyway because why not, Spouse had it, UKVI asked for it, so Spouse uploaded it. I do not think this had any effect on the decision but I could be wrong.\n\n**ACCOMMODATION**\n\nTENANCY AGREEMENT - Pretty standard stuff, Spouse rents and lives in a one bedroom apartment and obviously had to evidence where we would be staying together. From what I've read, there was no need for a Property Inspection Report. This irked us a little bit and there is a lot of conflicting information however from what I understood, there only had to be clear evidence that the accommodation is NOT OVERCROWDED. Spouse already had Applicant down as a permitted occupier on the agreement months in advance as he knew there would be a time when this may become reality.\n\nLETTER FROM LANDLORD - We thought we should just add this to strengthen the accommodation part of the application, we just asked our landlord to provide a letter confirming their approval of Applicant living with Spouse in said property on letterheaded paper. Landlord completed this within a few days and even used fancy words like \\*exclusively occupies\\* as well as commenting on the suitability of the apartment for a couple. Couldn't ask more for more really.\n\nUTILITY BILLS - Energy Bills, Water Bills, all dated within last 3 months\n\n**RELATIONSHIP**\n\nMARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WITH ENGLISH TRANSLATION - We had our Marriage Certificate translated and attested by an Advocate and Notary Public who is recognised and approved by the Bangladeshi Govt.\n\nRELATIONSHIP PHOTOS - We provided 10 Photographs from our wedding which we organised as a separate dated section in our PDF as well as 31 additional photographs from various times in our relationship. Maybe overkill, but we wanted to evidence a strong genuine relationship.\n\nRELATIONSHIP CALLS & TEXTS - This was a bit too personal for our liking, however we carefully curated a couple of screenshots for each month we spoke with each other. We chose to do did this after following what others in this community have had success with.\n\nFLIGHT ITINARARIES & BOARDING STAMPS/PASSES - We added these to show we have met in person. (Spouse travelled to Bangladesh to see Applicant at least twice a year)\n\nFINANCIAL REMITTANCE - We added payment receipts of remittances Spouse sent to Applicant to evidence financial support.\n\n**COVER LETTER**\n\nThe Cover Letter was the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\n\nWe broke it down into sections. Section 1, we wrote our entire relationship timeline highlighting the moments of importance in our relationship. Section 2 was the Financial Requirements, we wrote out our intentions of which category we would be applying under (Cat A), who Spouse was employed with, how much they were earning as well as doing the calculations for them using only SIX months payslips, **not** the 12 months they asked for. Section 3 was a section detailing the accommodation and how it is suitable for us. Section 4 was a little 'About Me' section regarding the Applicant. Section 5 was an affirmation of genuine intent, support for one another as well as what this application meant to both of us. The cover letter was our way of explaining how we meet all of the requirements. We did not leave any room for misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Every sentence was direct and clear cut in terms of addressing the necessary requirements we needed to meet.\n\nAlso, just so you have an idea of what we mean by doing the calculations... Here is an extract from our cover letter:\n\n*\"Annualised Income from Overtime and Enhanced Pay:*\n\n*(\u00a33434.69 / 6) x 12 = \u00a36869.38*\n\n*Total Gross Annual Salary:*\n\n*\u00a3XXXXX.XX + \u00a36869.38 = \u00a3XXXXX.XX\"*\n\nWe made it clear, using the HO's own calculations, exactly how to calculate the figures in accordance with Category A. I'm sure they already know this but considering we selected the wrong options on the Categories question, we wanted to double down on the intention of applying under Category A.\n\nAnd that is all of the evidence we provided.\n\nWe uploaded ALL files in a PDF Format. It was a bit of a nightmare trying to overcome the \"this file is infected with a virus\" message, however we found converting to PDF/A would allow the file to be uploaded. Our photographs had to be downscaled and compressed so that we could create a single PDF packed full with images, into a file that could satisfy the 5MB file size limit for uploading on VFSGlobal.  \nThe website does time out a lot so I urge you to just check the upload files page every time you log in and match it up with what you have in your desktop folder to see if they all have been uploaded correctly. We had a couple of uploads missed but on rechecking, we managed to identify and upload the files before Biometrics. It's crazy that the site doesn't even acknowledge any failed uploads!!! I named each file exactly what they were and in capital letters so that they can be easily identified by the decision maker. For example \"PAYSLIPS - SPOUSE'S NAME\" or \"BANK STATEMENTS - SPOUSE'S NAME\".\n\nAll in all, this was a very eye-opening experience, there were ups and downs, and the waiting felt like a lifetime, but we got there in the end. Some people may say we did too much, some may say we did quite little. I do not think there are right and wrong ways, but as the contributors say in this community, if you satisfy all of the requirements, and evidence exactly what the HO wants to see, you should have no problems.\n\nThe very best of luck to all those who are still waiting or yet to apply. I hope this post helps you as much as this community helped me.",

I think maybe actually seeing what someone else who has been through this would be super helpful and soothe my overthinking tendencies. Thanks in advance! \n\n",

    "title": "Application submitted, VFS is ATROCIOUS",
    "selftext": "(Warning - long read, detailed description of failure points of VFS system when attempting self-upload, apologies.)\n\nMy husband (US Citizen) and I (UK Citizen) applied two days ago for his spouse visa so that we can move to the UK.  We selected **standard** via application, we are doing **self-upload** of documents, and we selected **PRIORITY** from within the VFS system because we want to get an answer soon.  We have spent about two years researching everything and getting all of our documentation and finances in order for this application.  I am very OCD and so I had a pretty deeply-nested folder system of all of our documents to be uploaded.\n\nIn all, the UKVI website side of things went pretty smoothly.  We were able to just go at our own pace and fill out everything it asked for.  It is helpful that you can go online and create a dummy application weeks or months earlier so that you can learn what data they will be asking for.  \n\nHowever - as soon as the application was completed and submitted (and fees paid), we ran into problems.  Basically, **VFS**.  I know that many on here are aware of them and their reputation - as we were, to a certain degree.  However, the extent of trauma that VFS' system brings to the visa application process - we found - is *incalculable*.  The UKVI application took about three hours - and then we spent probably the next 18hrs fighting to get our supporting documentation uploaded to VFS' system.  \n\nFor anyone else who is intending on applying soon and trying to ensure they get all of their stuff sorted out, I wanted to list here major known issues that we encountered within VFS' system:\n\n1. After submitting your visa application to UKVI, you end up at a landing page where you can download a copy of your completed application (**DO.  THIS.  FIRST!!**), Also a button you can click to proceed to scheduling your biometrics appointment.  Of course we proceeded to click that button, as it is the next required step.  When you do this, it does NOT open in a new window.  It WILL open the VFS site/portal directly over your UKVI page that is still open.  Ensure you are fully finished with downloading your saved application in case you have issues logging back in to UKVI to retrieve it at a later date.\n2. When you click out to the VFS portal to begin scheduling your biometrics appointment (we all agree that this is an Important Thing\u00a9), it will immediately take you into your account (that you didn't know you have already) within VFS' system.  There is NO introduction to the portal, no registration process or \"please create your account\" welcome message - nothing.  It takes you to a random screen that handshakes immediately with your GWF Reference Number (that you haven't been introduced to yet), and shoves you into biometrics appointment scheduling.  \n3. When attempting to schedule your biometrics appointment at your nearest center, I would **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** that you use the most reliable and mainstream credit card you can.  The chances are that this will be the credit card that is sitting in your lap that has just been beaten up by the UKVI and IHS charges.  With us - this was the case - and it also proved one of the main sources of trauma we experienced during this whole process.  I would also recommend that - prior to beginning this application process - that you call said credit card company and request that they remove ALL security measures from you card for the 24-48hr period during which you will be applying.  We attempted to use a Wells Fargo Visa card within VFS' system for the biometrics appointment (and associated PRIORITY charge), and it immediately attempted to do an authentication/2FA check with the WF app on our phone.  The authentication check succeeded on our phone, but VFS's jank-filled system barfed and went to a blank screen that only had a \"Close\" button I could click.  After clicking that, it took us to another random blankish screen that simply said \"it is taking longer to verify your credit card transaction\" (or something like that).  It sat at that *forever*, with ZERO other options on the screen.  Just a dead VFS logo at the top-left that you can't even click on.  We proceeded to freak the hell out for those 30 mins.  We checked the WF app for the charge- nothing.  We called WF - all they saw was the two UKVI charges and nothing was hung up in security.  I literally sat on the verge of tears while my husband researched this glitch on all immigration forums he's been a member of for the past three years.  About 30mins later, it FINALLY cleared itself, returned us to our (as of yet unseen) VFS dashboard (hard learning curve), and showed a notification that the payment had failed for our biometrics appointment (and priority processing).  We then attempted to go back into the bio appt that was waiting for payment - however when we did that, we noticed that it had completely ERASED our priority processing selection (which is VERY important to us).  Not only that, but the option to toggle regular-vs-priority was now *broken* on the page for our existing appointment, leaving us entirely unable to reselect priority.  We ended up having to take our lives in our hands and CANCEL the existing bio appointment, and then proceed warily through it all again, selecting the same date and time and priority processing, and then used a different credit card.  It worked that time - about 45minutes and two migraines after.\n4. After recovering from that mess and going out for some food, later that evening we began the process of uploading documents.  VFS' self-upload facility is ATROCIOUS.  I was aware that they were going to provide a number of catch-all categories - but the actual product is ABYSMAL.  Multiple categories for 'education' and 'employment', but zero indication where to attach things such as evidence of marriage, comingled finances, or even copies of passports.  \n5. VFS' document upload file size is limited to 5MB **PER UPLOAD**, not per file as we were led to believe.  You can select several files at once (i.e. if you are doing monthly bank statements), but they must ALL total less than 5MB.  This makes uploading photographs (such as evidence of marriage) VERY laborious, as most photos (unless ran through software to downsize them), are 3-5MB a piece.  Bank statements with logos or fliers attached can be large also.  Multi-page documents such as mortgage paperwork can (and WILL) exceed the file size CONTINUALLY.  Make sure to sign up for a free Adobe Pro trial during your application timeframe so you can make changes to PDFs on the fly while trying to upload.\n6. You WILL encounter several errors within VFS' portal.  It will not sensibly inform you of these errors, and in most cases the error message itself will either not appear or it will not specify WHICH of your files the error message pertains to.  **Errors you will encounter include:  File Name Already Exists; File is Virus Infected!; File Size Exceeds 5MG Limit.**  The absolute worst one is \"File is Virus Infected!\" - this means that some (or all, or a few - who knows!) of your PDFs are created with digital signatures or other security software that VFS' system is rejecting.  It does NOT mean your files have viruses!  This particularly applies to PDFs downloaded directly from a provider's website - so think bank statements, insurance bills, utility bills, etc. etc.  As these items were the MAJORITY of what we were attempting to provide to prove our marriage, we were met with this error time and time again - like, probably on up to 50 files.  I ended up having to spend the majority of the weekend hunched over my laptop having to resave a TON of our evidence files via the \"Print to PDF\" function.  This is the ONLY way to get around it and simply using Adobe to merge, compress or do something else to them will NOT work.  \n7. You WILL completely, irrevocably, and wholly lose track of your file upload process.  VFS' system dumps them into whatever category you select, in absolutely zero order.  Everything will be scattered to the winds, and you are going to have a VERY hard time of it verifying that you have uploaded everything.\n8. Do NOT attempt to verify all your documents are there BEFORE saving your upload at the bottom of the page!  VFS' system pushes through **one** time-out warning (where you can click 'stay logged in'), while you are queuing files to upload - then, after that (and at random unspecified moments) it will COMPLETELY log you out.  No option to stay logged in, nothing.  It will log you out DURING uploads (it did to us).  DO NOT attempt to do more than ten or so files without saving the current upload, returning to your dashboard, completely logging out of their system, closing your browser, and then restarting the whole process again - because you will lose ALL of your work.  This will happen repeatedly.  Ensure you have a bookmarked way to get back to the log-in, or use it from the email you get sent after your application is submitted.\n9. You ARE able to save a few files and then return back in to your document upload center again and again.  This is good - HOWEVER, know that once files have been saved and uploaded in this manner, you are no longer able to preview the files to ensure that they stayed legible and are what you intended.  If you must, preview your queued files quickly BEFORE going to the bottom and saving them.  Again - once saved, they are protected from being lost on one of the timeouts or error messages, BUT you will no longer be able to preview them to check and double-check they're there in good order. \n\nIf anything else comes to my mind, I will include it - but I at least want others who are preparing to apply to be aware of the system that they are about to have to navigate.  \n\nTl;dr - got our application and documents submitted, lost two days, now need therapy.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently in the process of applying for a UK spouse visa and had a question I hoped someone here could help me with. I've been trying to satisfy the financial requirement, specifically the cash savings route, but I\u2019m running into a dilemma.\n\nMost of my funds are tied up in U.S.-based accounts\u2014some are retirement accounts or longer-term investments that would incur penalties or losses if I were to withdraw them now. I *do* have enough money on paper, but transferring or cashing out these funds just to have them sit in a UK bank for 6 months feels inefficient and costly.\n\nA few questions for those who\u2019ve been through this:\n\n* Has anyone successfully used U.S.-based investment accounts like 401k, Roth IRA etc to meet the financial requirements?\n* Were you able to *show* proof of access to funds without actually withdrawing them? I recently withdrew a large amount of money and put into my saving account, then was promptly told its lowest balance was x even though I had the money in the account, does this mean I just have to wait 6 months? \n* This seems silly as the money has been in my account for years and has been in cash for more than 6 months, not investments, cash... \n* If you *did* have to withdraw funds, how did you avoid penalties (or did you just bite the bullet)?\n* Are there any alternatives or lesser-known approaches that the Home Office accepts for proving financial stability?\n\nI\u2019m married to a British citizen and we\u2019re planning to move to the UK soon. I\u2019d love to hear how others navigated this part of the process.\n\nThanks in advance\u2014really appreciate any insight or shared experiences.\n\n\\-M",

When I asked him why he put the P60 salary he said when UKVI searches for your salary they will find what is on the P60.\n\nIn any case it all went well, didn't need much time at all to compile all the evidence.",

I have a job offer for my employer's UK branch which isn't listed as a sponsor that'll set me for 30k a year, but I'm stuck on the sponsor part where I need to fill in my partner's finances.\n\nShe is unemployed, does gig work through busking, performances with her band and occassional work for a charity which earned her only 850 pounds last year due to illness. There are no tax details as she's neglected them for years.\n\nWill this be the death of my application, or will my income overshadow the shortcomings?\n\nPS. I had an A1 document allowing me to work under contract of my home country's company branch in the UK for half a year while I settled the VISA over there, but they recalled me after just 2 weeks leading me to be forced to do the application here. Hence things have gotten a lot more complicated.",

I just have a few quick questions!\n\n1. I was doing some digging but couldn't quite tell if there are any different rules and requirements for the extension/renewal of the spouse visa, or if it's literally just submitting all of the same things (proof we live together, our marriage certificate, our income/finances, etc) again or if there are any new kinds of documents we'd need to submit?\n\n2. At the end of my spouse visa extension, I plan to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under the 5 year route. I can't remember where I read this but I seem to have a memory of needing to prove that you were in the UK on a certain date- maybe it was five years from your date of application for ILR, to prove you've been in the UK for exactly five years??- in order to submit your application, and I was wondering how on earth that works? Do you submit payslips or are you meant to have a photo of you outside your house or something? It feels so silly to ask and maybe I'm just making it up but if anyone knows what I'm talking about, please let me know! I don't want future me to be let down by current me :)\n\n  \nThanks so much in advance (this subreddit kept me sane through the initial spouse visa process, and definitely saved me a few times!)",

We opted for the student visa because, at the time, my husband was not paying taxes in the UK because he lived in Pakistan. My question is: do I need to justify why I initially came on a Student Visa?\n\nSECOND QUESTION - The reason why we decided to move to the UK is for: \n\n1. Career growth\n2. My husband's brother and SIL are here and his parents will also be moving later in the year (all of them are UK citizens)\n3. In due time, we want to start our family and raise our children in an inclusive environment, which UK has to offer\n\nAre all these reasons acceptable to mention? \n\nThank you so much in advance!

    "selftext": "Hello, everyone! I wanted to share our experience with the application process. I think our process was quite unique because we sent in additional supporting documents that we failed to submit for scanning through VFS even if we were not asked to do so. We did this because we thought our application lacked supporting documents :( \n\nThe initial supporting documents that we submitted were so sparse compared to everyone else's! My husband and I only learned about this subreddit after my application and biometrics were submitted --- to say that it has been a nerve-wracking past few weeks is an understatement! \n\nApplied from VFS (Philippines) - paid for Priority Service \n\n* Application date: May 10th\n* Bio date: May 26th --> opted for VFS to scan supporting documents\n* ECO email: May 29th\n* Sent additional documents that we wanted to add through ECO email instructions: June 3rd\n* Approval email: June 18th\n\nOur application was straightforward: husband is a British Citizen, his employment meets the financial threshold, has been in a long-distance relationship since 2019, got married last December 2024\n\n**Initially**, we only submitted the following supporting documents (because I just stuck to what was on the checklist): \n\n**Sponsorship**\n\n* Photocopy of Sponsor's Passport\n* Employment Letter indicating his position, salary, and duration of employment \n\n**Proof of Relationship**\n\n* Marriage Certificate\n* 10-page PPT with timeline of our relationship, how we met, photos of our travels together, screenshots of our flights, hotel bookings, tours, photos of our families, photos of our wedding day\n* (Shared Financial Responsibility) Bank Certificate of our Joint Bank Account\n* (Shared Financial Responsibility) Screenshots of his Wise transfers to my bank account; corresponding amounts entering my bank account through my bank statement\n\n**English Language Proficiency**\n\n* ECCTIS letter that confirms my degree meets CEFR level B2\n* School documents (Bachelor's Degree Diploma, Master's Degree Diploma, Certificate from my University indicating English as Medium of Instruction)\n\n**TB Test**\n\n**My Passport**\n\n*These were all the documents that I submitted.* I bet you would immediately notice that I didn't submit anything that showed sufficient accommodations or proof of my husband's income. At this point, my husband and I were nervous wrecks! We felt so unprepared. We combed through the internet until we stumbled on a post from years ago that said they sent additional documents through the details provided in the ECO Email. \n\nWe opted to follow this advice and followed Option 3 in the VFS Global Supporting Documents tab which shows the **\"Step-by-step guide to sending documents for scanning by post\"**. Since my husband was in the UK, he sent the following additional documents:\n\n**Accommodations**\n\n* Proof of Home Ownership of his parents\n* Invitation letter from his parents indicating that we can stay with them\n* Photocopy of his parents' passports\n\n**Sponsorship**\n\n* last 6 months payslip \n* bank statements showing the corresponding payslip amounts entering his account\n* Letter from my husband indicating he will support me\n\n**Misc**\n\n* Cover letter indicating that these additional documents *supplement* the initial supporting documents we have already submitted with VFS \n\nHusband posted these items along with the cover page of my application letter + sworn declaration. He received the documents a few days later with additional barcode separators; suggesting that the recipient went through the documents. **However, we didn't receive any feedback if these documents were added to our application.** \n\nWe don't really know if the additional documents that we sent to the VFS Scanning Hub in the UK helped our application, or if our application would have been approved even without these additional documents. But I thought it would be helpful to share it here in case anyone is on the same boat. :) \n\n  \nCheers!! \n\nUPDATE: finally made it to the UK. Flew in on 16 July \ud83e\udd70 reminder to those flying out from the Philippines - you need to have your CFO Certificate. PH Immigration asks for it, especially for those flying out on their Spouse Visa for the first time. ",

    "selftext": "Hello community \ud83d\udc4b I hope to get some advice on my second spouse visa application. In particular I want to double check all my documents before my biometrics in 2 days time. \n\nSo long story short here is our situation. We are married since November 2024, my husband works in IT and has basically moved in with me in Romania since February 2024 as he can work remotely. He earns well above the threshold and is a dual citizen (UK and Romanian). He has been employed at the same company for 5 years plus. \n\nThe first time the visa was refused as I took the wrong English test \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb went for Cambridge instead of IELTS. The second reason was because in the evidence we only provided the marriage certificate and the officer didn\u2019t believe we ever met in person and are in a genuine relationship. The rest of the application was fine back then as it was stated in the decision letter. \n\nNow onto the second application which we are about to provide biometrics for. I have provided the correct ielts speaking and listening for UKVI at A1 level. And for the relationship I have provided again the marriage certificate, multiple flight tickets  with both our names on them and some separate ones from when we have visited each other and also him visiting me as well as times we went on holidays together (4 holidays abroad together). We also attached bookings from hotels , about 20 pictures ranging from when we met until today, a letter explaining our timeline since we met , 2 witness statements from one of my friends and one of his friends as well as bank statements in his name , showing he withdrew money and paid at Lidl in Romania , in my home town all from different months. \n\nOur Accomodation in the uk is as follows. He has a mortgage in his name for a house with 3 bedrooms and a living room and has 3 lodgers (a married couple and their 14 year old son). We provided a copy of the contract of sale and a bank statement from the mortgage provider from the past 12 months, stamped by the bank. \n\nFor his employment we provided 12 months payslips, a letter from the employment to show his title , salary , type of employment (permanent) and since when he was employed. Also provided bank statements from his bank where his salary is paid for the last 6 months. \n\nThe rest of the application is the same as last time, just with the latest documents so that they are up to date. \n\nIn my head everything is ok but I just wanted to get some reassurance and if advice if I can include anything else. Obviously having been refused once already made me second guess every stop of the application and every document.  \n\nDoes all the above sound like a solid application this time round. We really want this all to work out this time!",

    "selftext": "Hi all! I wanted to share my experience with the U.S. naturalization process and a free tool I built to help with the civics test, in case it\u2019s useful to others going through it.\nI started my U.S. immigration journey in 2018 on an F-1 student visa. I later got married to a U.S. citizen and became a green card holder in 2021. Earlier this year, I applied for naturalization and recently passed my interview in New York (June 2025).\nFor me, the most stressful part was preparing for the civics test, where there are 100 questions of which any 10 of which can be asked at the interview. I wanted something I could quickly review on my phone, ideally in flashcard format. But I couldn\u2019t find a free tool that didn\u2019t require installing an app or making an account.\nSo I built this: https://sunnybathroom.github.io/civicsflashcard/\nWhat it does: (1) fully browser-based and works on mobile and desktop. No download, no login; (2) randomized flashcards of the official 100 USCIS questions; (3) tracks what you get wrong, so you can review those only.\nI\u2019m working on adding a voice/audio feature next to simulate how the real interview feels. But this basic version helped me a ton during commutes or short breaks.\nIf you\u2019re preparing for the naturalization test (or just curious about the process), I hope it helps!",

I entered the U.S. on an F-1 visa post-COVID but couldn\u2019t start school that fall. I filed for asylum due to genuine dangers in my home country. I graduated in 2024 and married my U.S. citizen spouse in March 2025. While preparing to file an I-130 and I-485, I discovered an in absentia removal order from May 2025. I never received a Notice to Appear (NTA) or any notice, likely due to an old address.\nI couldn\u2019t afford an attorney\u2019s $20k fee, so I filed a pro se appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in June 2025 to preserve my case\u2014it\u2019s still pending. My asylum-based EAD was revoked, and I only have an I-130 receipt. I\u2019m frustrated and unsure what to do. Here\u2019s my dilemma:\n\u2022  Should I file a motion to reopen with the BIA, since my appeal is pending there?\n\u2022  Or should I withdraw the BIA appeal and file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge (IJ)? Someone told me appeals of in absentia orders must start with the IJ, and my appeal might be dismissed/denied for lack of jurisdiction! \n\u2022  My marriage and I-130 could support adjusting my status\u2019s, but the removal order complicates things.\nHas anyone dealt with this? Should I focus on the lack of notice for the removal order or my marriage as grounds to reopen? Any advice on navigating this mess would mean a lot. Thanks!",

No approval, no decision, just complete silence.\nI even reached out to the Australian Embassy to try and expedite the process but I\u2019ve received no response. I\u2019m now completely out of ideas and the August 4th deadline is just days away.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if ANU will give me another extension. I don\u2019t know if I can request to start classes online somehow while I wait for the visa. I don\u2019t even know who to contact anymore. But this is my dream.

I have a steady income and can cover her living expenses, the tuition and books/supplies might get a little dicey. We honestly haven\u2019t been together super long but it feels like we\u2019ll never know how our relationship could turn out unless we try and buy some time. I also don\u2019t wanna burn myself either. The relationship has gone great so far. Does anyone have advice or recommendations on the best way to navigate this?\n\nThanks!",

    "title": "I came to Germany as a student without a clear plan \u2013 now I might be exmatriculated again. Can I reapply for a visa later if I leave voluntarily?",
    "selftext": "I came to Germany in June 2023. At the time, I was very excited and hopeful. But the truth is, I came without a real plan. I just wanted to leave my country. I didn't take things seriously, especially regarding my studies and discipline.  \nThe only thing I was good at was working. I had no problems with it, and I loved being responsible. But I came on a student visa, so studying had to be my priority, even if I needed to work to support myself financially.  \nIn September 2023, the university required me to pass the A2 German language exam or I would be expelled from the university. I didn't pass, partly because I had just arrived in June, partly because it was difficult to get appointments, and partly because I was careless and lazy. So, I was expelled from the university just four months after arriving. According to the law, I was supposed to report to the Immigration Office (Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde) immediately within two weeks, but I didn't. I wanted to get a new admission before reporting them. I finally received a new university admission in March 2024 and reported it to the Immigration Office. However, they took away my residence permit and said that what I had done was illegal, and I should have reported it much earlier.\n\nThey did, however, accept the change of university, but under one strict condition: I am not allowed to change my program again. They granted me a new two-year residence permit, valid until May 2026.\n\nI'm currently studying robotics, but honestly, I'm having a really hard time. It's very difficult for me; I study a lot of math, electronics, and programming. I've failed several exams. I swear I've really changed after my first mistake in 2023. I've become more serious this year, but this program simply isn't for me.\n\nNow, due to my failing exams, I may be expelled from the university again in September or October.\n\nSo I have some questions, and I would appreciate any advice, especially from anyone who has gone through a similar experience:\n\nIs it better to voluntarily leave the program and return home (for personal reasons), rather than waiting for the university to expel me again?\n\nIf I return home and study German diligently (because I was studying in English before), can I reapply for a student visa in the future, perhaps for a program that suits me perfectly?\n\nWhat should I write in my next visa application if I want to return to Germany after preparing well? Can I just say that I left for personal reasons, learned from my experience, and now have a better plan?\n\nI can add some things to my advantage, such as the fact that I volunteered several times, and also add a reason for returning with evidence, such as a certificate stating that my mother was ill (which is true) and that I had to take care of her.\n\nI know some may blame me. Yes, I made serious mistakes. But I really changed. 2025 was the best year of my life in terms of personal growth. I couldn't handle the robotics program. It wasn't the right program for me. And because of the immigration situation, I didn't have the option to change my major again.\n\nIf anyone here has had the experience of leaving Germany and returning later with a new visa, please share your story, especially how the second visa application process went and how you explained your situation.\n\nThank you all.",

    "selftext": "**Edit:** *Wishing everyone good luck and a bit more patience with each other on these topics. I won\u2019t be checking replies going forward, as the thread seems to have reached its constructive limits. Thanks to those who offered genuine insight and helped me better understand the situation \u2014 we\u2019ll likely pivot and plan for universities in other countries, as U.S. schools seem a bad fit due to my citizenship status. Cheers for your time.*\n\nMy (U.S. citizen) wife (Korean citizen) was denied her F1 visa in Seoul under 214(b). She is currently enrolled at a top 25 global university in the States; we already have student housing established, and she was awarded a scholarship from her school. Her semester is set to begin in late July.\n\nWe have been married and living in Korea for nearly ten years \u2014 at no point have we made any effort to immigrate to the States, applied for an I-130, etc. Neither of us have any interest in moving to America. She has no history of staying in America for long periods of time, only visiting every few years to see family.\n\nShe decided to pursue her MA in her field and was admitted to a handful of top-tier U.S. universities on scholarships. She selected among those the one that best fits her career goals.\n\nWe have significant financial assets in Korea, property under her name, as well as a business filed under both our names.\n\nI\u2019m extremely confused about what could have led to her 214(b) denial.\n\nIf we wanted to immigrate, we could have just applied for the I-130 \u2014 there is no reason to needlessly jump through the hoops of the F1 process if that was our intention. Neither of us has any desire to permanently relocate to America.\n\nSome complications: her sister is in the States on a student visa. Again, I am a U.S. citizen and have family in the States.\n\nNothing really beyond that.\n\nFrom what my wife recounted, they asked her about her school of choice, her study plans, what I do/have done in Korea, what I intend to do in the States, and then they proffered the denial form.\n\nHer semester begins in 10 days. Again, we already have student housing, scholarships, and funding in place, and have done everything by the books.\n\nShe has made a second appointment and scheduled to meet with consultants in hopes that we can get another shot at approval \u2014 otherwise, we will have to defer her enrollment for a year. I can\u2019t understand why she\u2019d be denied; as I said, we could have applied for an I-130 at any point in the last decade if that was our intention.\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating to think that we could be forced to defer enrollment because of this judgment. Beyond that, I can\u2019t make sense of a situation where I\u2019m somehow put in a position to file an I-130 \u2014 just so my wife can attend graduate school \u2014 when neither of us has any desire to stay in America. Isn\u2019t that exactly why the F1 exists in the first place?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Since I know that my parents will never get a green card before I age out of my H4 visa, I switched into the F1 student visa, hoping that it will help me land internships that will eventually lead to full-time job opportunities. But it all seems so hopeless. The entry level job market is bad for citizens, and nearly impossible for internationals. The H1-B lottery success rate is incredibly low. And the average wait time for an Indian citizen getting a green card is reaching the length of a lifetime.

I want to leave India legally within 12 months, not through a student visa, but by building a career that gets me into Canada via either PR or work permit.\n\nI\u2019ve selected the Health Data Analyst / Revenue Cycle Analyst path. I already have experience in medical billing and now I\u2019m learning:\n- Advanced Excel\n- SQL\n- Power BI\n- Basics of healthcare analytics\n\nHere\u2019s my plan (please let me know if this sounds realistic):\n\n\u2705 Get IELTS done (aiming 7+ band)  \n\u2705 Apply for WES (I did BCA from Vanita Vishram University)  \n\u2705 Build 2\u20133 small portfolio projects using healthcare data  \n\u2705 Apply for Express Entry  \n\u2705 While waiting, apply for jobs in Canada that offer LMIA  \n\u2705 Move legally via PR or job sponsorship\n\nI\u2019ve seen some posts saying healthcare/analytics might be too saturated, but I\u2019m willing to work really hard. I just want to know:\n\n1. Does this seem like a solid 1-year plan?  \n2. Any risks with WES accepting a BCA from Vanita Vishram?  \n3. Is this role good for PR or job-based visa? Or should I consider switching fields completely?  \n4. Any advice from people who took a similar path?\n\nThanks so much for your time. I\u2019d really appreciate some honest feedback before I go all in.",

Like become a student without needing several semesters worth of tuition?? \n\nI hope my question is making sense wo sounding like I'm just asking to be a bum on the street lmao I want to make it to the country and THEN be able to build my life, not build a whole life before leaving. I'm just seeing this wave of people immigrating and I wonder how they do it, if it's their job or education or just they have the money, idk",

    "selftext": "Holy shit. It\u2019s finally over. After 3 years, 2 RFEs, 1 canceled interview, and approximately 37 mental breakdowns, I\u2019m holding my Green Card in my hands. Here\u2019s the real, unfiltered story of what it took to get here \u2013 the good, the bad, and the downright ridiculous.\n\n**The Timeline From Hell:**\n\n* **March 2021:**\u00a0Submitted I-130 (spouse visa) with a lawyer who promised \"12-18 months max!\"\u00a0*Cue laugh track*\n* **August 2021:**\u00a0First RFE hits \u2013 USCIS claims we didn\u2019t prove our marriage was real. Bro, we sent wedding photos, joint bank statements, leases, even our fucking Netflix account. Had to get notarized letters from friends and family saying \"yes, they\u2019re really married.\"\n* **February 2022:**\u00a0Case finally approved... only to disappear into the NVC black hole for 8 months. Radio silence.\n* **October 2022:**\u00a0Interview scheduled! Canceled 3 days before because of \"staffing shortages.\" Got rescheduled 6 months later.\n* **July 2024:**\u00a0Woke up to a \"Case Approved\" notification. No interview. No warning. Just... done.\n\n**The Absolute Worst Parts Nobody Talks About:**\n\n1. **The USCIS Black Hole:**\u00a0Going months without updates while your life is on hold. Calling them was like talking to a brick wall until I learned the magic words: \"outside normal processing time.\"\n2. **RFE Roulette:**\u00a0Even with a $3k lawyer, we got hit with two RFEs. Pro tip: Whatever evidence your lawyer says is enough, double it. Triple it. Send them your childhood diaries if you have to.\n3. **The Mental Toll:**\u00a0Putting your life on pause for years \u2013 turning down jobs, not visiting family, delaying kids \u2013 because \"what if the visa comes through?\"\n\n**What Actually Helped (From Someone Who\u2019s Been Through It):**\n\n* **Document EVERYTHING:**\u00a0Think you\u2019ve sent enough proof? Send more. Wedding invites, text logs, photos with timestamps, joint Amazon Prime account \u2013 USCIS eats this shit up.\n* **Be the Squeaky Wheel:**\u00a0If your case is past processing time, call every day. Be polite but persistent. One Tier 2 officer finally moved our case after months of nothing.\n* **Reddit/VisaJourney Saved Me:**\u00a0The forums knew more than our lawyer. Crowdsourced knowledge is power.\n\n**To Everyone Still Waiting:**  \nI see you. I was you. The uncertainty is brutal, but it does end. Eventually. AMA about this nightmare process \u2013 happy to help others survive it.\n\nAnd to USCIS: I never want to see another Form I- ever again. Peace out.\n\n",

My cousin has refused because he\u2019s a skilled football player with professional potential, but he\u2019s now receiving death threats and is in hiding.\n\nMy entire immediate family (parents + myself) are NZ permanent residents. My dad previously sponsored my cousin\u2019s NZ visitor visa (he visited NZ in the past and complied with all conditions).\n\nHis mother (a single parent) and grandmother cannot protect him\u2014they live in extreme poverty in a high-risk area and fear retaliation. He has never been involved in gangs and is desperate to leave SA legally. I wanted to hear here first and know also what evidence we would need before enquiring. \nQuestions:\n1. Victims of Family Violence Work Visa: Given that my family are NZ PRs and he\u2019s facing violence from a family member (uncle), could he qualify despite not being in NZ yet?\n2. Alternative Pathways:\n    * Given his prior visitor visa (sponsored by my dad), could we reapply and then seek protection?\n    * Would a Humanitarian Visa or Refugee Status be possible given the documented threats?\n3. Sponsorship: As PRs, can my family sponsor him for a work/student visa if we show financial support?\n4. Urgency: Are there emergency immigration options given the direct threats?",

Even though most of the so-called \u201cmigration problem\u201d is caused by illegal immigration and refugee crises, it\u2019s often the legal migrants who end up being punished.

I know predictions are never 100% accurate, but any informed thoughts or reassurance would really help. \n",

That alone was devastating but I refused to give up on my education.\n\nI applied to universities in Australia and got accepted into Australian National University ANU, one of the top universities in the country. They accepted most of my US credits and I was beyond relieved. I\u2019ve already\n\u2022 Paid my first semester\u2019s full tuition\n\u2022 Enrolled in my classes\n\u2022 Secured my accommodation\n\nThe classes officially started on July 21st, but I requested a delay due to visa issues and the university kindly gave me an extension until August 4th.\n\nThe problem\nI applied for my Australian student visa almost a month ago and there\u2019s still no update. No approval, no decision, just complete silence.\nI even reached out to the Australian Embassy to try and expedite the process but I\u2019ve received no response. I\u2019m now completely out of ideas and the August 4th deadline is just days away.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if ANU will give me another extension. I don\u2019t know if I can request to start classes online somehow while I wait for the visa. I don\u2019t even know who to contact anymore. But this is my dream. I\u2019ve already lost one chance in the US and I can\u2019t afford to lose this too.\n\nI\u2019ve done everything right\n\u2022 My documents were complete\n\u2022 I have good academic standing\n\u2022 No criminal record\n\u2022 A strong study plan\n\u2022 Everything paid and ready to go\n\nPlease if anyone has gone through this before or knows what I can do, I\u2019d be so grateful for your help. Even if you don\u2019t, any advice, direction, or even emotional support would mean a lot to me right now.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019m desperate to know\n\u2022 Is there any way to expedite the visa process at this point\n\u2022 Can ANU allow further deferral or temporary online start until I get my visa\n\u2022 Has anyone dealt with long student visa wait times from Australia recently\n\u2022 Any official contacts or people who might help speed things up\n\nThank you to anyone who read this. I\u2019ve worked so hard to hold onto my education and I feel like I\u2019m watching it slip away again. Please help in any way you can. Even the smallest reply helps.\n\nPosting this across relevant subreddits because I really don\u2019t have time and I need advice fast.",

I am still currently waiting for admission results but I have already prepared some documents. I have one concern lang in applying for a resident visa. My sponsor is my grandfather so I will be using his bank statement. We requested for a bank statement last June 4, 2025 to submit to the school as part of the admission requirements. That time, the balance in his account was more than the required amount of NTD 120,000. However, the bank statement for resident visa application needs to be issued within 30 days. I will be applying in August this year so the bank statement I initially requested is no longer valid. My problem now is that since my grandfather is a contractual seafarer, he is currently on vacation and will resume employment this August as well, because of this, his bank balance has gone down to below the required amount because he withdrew funds for personal use. How can I present this to TECO Manila? Will they accept it if I submit a new bank statement which is below the required amount? I also plan on showing proof of his employment and that he will be working again this August. Pahelp po, thank you!\n\nTL;DR: Applying for a Taiwan student visa.

I am now trying to apply for a student visa since the program starts in September, but all the appt slots are full for my branch (San Francisco).\n\n They say in their email that you must be in the United States while applying for a visa. Is that just for the in person appointment though? In theory if I cannot get my appointment until mid-September or so, could I enter Spain on a tourist 90 day entry and then exit to retrieve my student visa once it's ready and re-enter? Is that a bad idea? \n\nJust a little sad I may not have a VISA in time to go on the program. I've emailed the office and am just waiting to hear something (if anything) back.",

    "selftext": "This is just a vent. And hopefully someone can learn something from my mistakes! \nSo my visa process starts in January of this year with me learning about the Cambodian background check for us citizens to get a Spain student visa for September. As you may be aware Cambodia is not a part of Hague Apostille Convention. Meaning I have to get the background check. Get it approved by the foreign affairs office in Cambodia and get it approved by the closest Spain consulate which is in Bangkok, Thailand. Lot more complicated then it sounds. I started that process in March of this year and just last week friday mid July got the paperwork. Two, I don't get back stateside untill June so I can't get my background started till then, thankfully that was easier than expected. Unfortunately I still had to get my background check apostalized by the state department so that got sent in ASAP. Got it back will last week mid - July.  Three, I have health issues. I had to find a student insurance that's not insanely expensive but still covers what I need to. Four,  What you'll learn in the paragraph is I don't make a lot of money so saving for this has been a big deal. \n\nSide note I was told by the consulate that I could mail my paperwork in. Yay. I'm a baker at a small company so I really can't get/ take time off work. But today reaching back out to get the address I get this email: saying I must go down to the San Francisco consulate to submit my paperwork. I live in Bellingham Washington. I really can't afford to get time off to try to get a appointment, for a visa I may or may not get because of my Cambodian background check and other various issues/ I'm special things. \n\nI have gotten all of my housing set up. Bought my tickets. Put my deposit down. Got accepted into the school which I thought was going to be the hardest part and a job offer while I'm in Spain. What the f*** is this process Spain. \n\nAnyway again just venting. Wondering if anybody else has been having these issues. ",

I am currently working on my EEF and was hoping to get some notes of tips on writing my Personal Statement. Any and all comments would be extremely helpful! Thank you so much.\n\n  \nI am born and raised in Los Angeles. Now living in San Francisco, I have been limited to Southern California with my education and general life experiences. I have been attending a bachelor for animation college program in the United States for 2 years, and realized that I am in need of a traditional art program. I am part of my current colleges deans list, having a 3.96 GPA, and feel studying a traditional art program would be a positive challenge in my academic experiences. I have chosen to attend Gobelins Paris because it is considered the top school in the world for animation, and has been a dream school of mine since I was 12 years old. I have been admitted for Gobelins International Preparatory year which is a one year program starting September 2nd. As of now, I have secured housing and found a sponsor. I have plans to apply to Gobelins 3 year bachelor program that would start (if admitted) September 2026. Idealistically, I will attend Gobelins for their preparatory year starting this September, and sequentially attend their Bachelor program for 3 years after that. That would be 4 years studying in France starting this September. I would like to work in the French animation industry after graduation. I admire France\u2019s history with animation, and would like to contribute to the future of French animation. I am studying French currently and have goals to become fluent during my next year studying at Gobelins.",

    "selftext": "Good evening all,\n\nI'm a British national and have applied to the Nashville Teacher Residency, completed the first two rounds of interviews, and intend to attend next summer (starting July 2026). As such, I've deferred and had confirmation of approval *to* defer from the coordinators, but they haven't supplied me any additional tasks or requested any information yet (though I'm imagining that might be due to my deferral meaning I'm more on the back burner than students joining this academic year). Note: **I've not had confirmation of an offer to study yet.** \n\nNow, here's where things get complicated (in my mind):\n\nThe residency starts in 'Mid-July' - until I have a firm offer of study, I won't have a start date which makes obtaining the visa tricky in the first instance.\n\nIt's a 'residency' as opposed to a traditional university-based study programme. Does this change the visa requirement from an F1 to J1 as it is a vocational pursuit? And would this complicate the 'no-work' stipulation of typical student visas, as it is a work/study programme?\n\nWhen I spoke to the coordinators, they did specify that they couldn't guarantee but imagine it might be likely for me to receive sponsorship for a work visa by the local education board, or an independent school, after my completion of the course.\n\nA big reason for electing for this programme is that my partner, whom I met at university in the UK, is from Nashville - he moved back a couple of years ago due to issues outside our control, and I want to see things from a different perspective, having never lived out of the UK before. That and the residency model provides a dramatically different style of educator training to the conventional PGCSE route in the UK - and I am curious about the differences in Anglo-American educational practice. The residency is also paid where a PGCSE isn't - and graduation comes with a discount at a prestigious Tennessee university for further pursuit of education study.\n\nHe and I have spoken about the possibility of converting my visa to a fiance while I'm out there, or getting married at some point during my studies, but I'm scared of how this might complicate things, too. I don't want it to look like I'm in the US purely for the sake of a relationship - because I'm not - but at this point, both my relationship and my studies are very closely entangled. We've kept continuous evidence of our relationship anyway, just in case we do have to 'fall back' on that route.\n\nI have strong ties to home with family and likely have an offer of a PCGE in my locality (I've two degrees and a lot of experience working in special needs education), so the 'return' requirement of the visa should be easy to complete.\n\nI'm hoping this won't be as complicated as I'm making it sound.",

    "selftext": "I'm adopted from South Korea, and recently was given the opportunity to study abroad in South Korea by my community college. Well.. because I'm adopted I needed two extra documents when applying for my student visa: certificate of citizenship and loss of Nationality. After missing the spring semester to study abroad so I can focus on applying and retrieving the necessary documents, I was finally able to completely get them late May. \nHowever, I needed to drive (4 hours) to San Francisco to get my Loss of Nationality documents (?). Because of the distance, I called and texted hoping I could get it mailed to me instead. Over text my message was left on delivered and over call they could not understand my question.. So in mid June I drove out to San Francisco to get the documents only for the man behind the counter tell me he lost them. He was quick to reassure me, however, that I could still apply for my student visa because I had my certificate of citizenship.\nWell, just two days ago I received a phone call from the SF Korean Embassy telling me that I need my loss of Nationality documents in order to receive approval. I tried my absolute hardest to explain to her my situation, and she looked up online for my documents (I'm quite unsure on this part, however, because all she asked was for my korean name and the month I made the application). In the end, she came up with nothing and basically kept reiterating herself on how I need my loss of Nationality paperwork.\nThe fall semester for the korean University I'm hoping to go to starts early August. This gives me only two and a half weeks to get my visa. I'm going to San Fransisco early tomorrow morning to hopefully explain my situation better in-person. I wasn't able to make a reservation, but I feel as though no reservation should be required.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is: Is there a way for me to look up online my loss of Nationality report? If I reapplied for a copy of my loss of Nationality, would it come on time? And how should I better explain my situation to the embassy?",

The problem- The Italian consulate here in Mumbai requests apostille and Higher Education Department attestation of my high school diploma and transcript.  IB doesn\u2019t give out a diploma until October. However, multiple visits to the Higher Education Department have yielded a sticky situation- since IB and my school - which is a private school\u2014 are unrecognised by the Indian and State Government, my documents are outside their purview, which means that attestation and apostille is not possible. The other route is getting an apostille via SDM(Sub-divisional Magistrate) but the visa authorities don\u2019t accept that. The consulate here happens to be extremely stubborn on these cases and I have a senior who completed this visa process 3 years ago to go to Bocconi and didn\u2019t have to get the apostille and attestation procedures done but for some reason they\u2019re not accepting this now. So please help me. How do I get my visa application in order. Especially given these bureaucratic holes I must jump through. Any other IB students from India going to Italy that can share their guidance please? ",

However, the amount was credited into a **newly opened account**, so it doesn\u2019t have 6 months of history \u2014 which I now know is something they prefer to see.\n\nThe second issue is with my father's **pension account statement**.  \nWhen I submitted my documents at **VFS Global**, I was informed that the pension statement would be required \u2014 but honestly, I wasn\u2019t aware of this beforehand. I tried downloading it through the Union Bank portal right away, but couldn\u2019t access it. Despite repeated attempts, I was unable to obtain the statement, so I submitted an explanation letter along with the rest of my documents.\n\nAlso, some of you may have seen a post I made earlier regarding a minor form-related issue and a verification call \u2014 won\u2019t go into that again, but just for context, that situation also involved a call to my employer where not everything may have been clearly communicated.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Has anyone submitted a loan disbursed into a new account (under 6 months old) and still gotten approval?\n* Has anyone missed a salary/pension account statement and explained it in writing \u2014 and been okay?\n* If verification calls don\u2019t go exactly right, does that always lead to problems?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing from anyone who\u2019s been through something similar. Thanks so much in advance \ud83d\ude4f",

The above details are filled up with pen and though the certificate has all the appropriate signatories by government officials, they are with pens and ink stamps. The bigger issue is that as it was pre digitalization, the certificate number is not present on the municipality server though being authentic.\n\nI was not aware of any such requirements as it is not specified in the list of documents. Can I proceed with the visa with this certificate?\n\nAlso I can apply for a conversion of this one where it will be reprinted and details will be verifiable online. However it will take about a month and during this time this certificate will be taken from me. Hence I will be without an official certificate for the time being.",

I did it online through the official VFS Global website and found that dates were readily available. I secured a slot for June 12th, 2025.\n\n**Documents I Submitted:**\n\nI made sure to have all my documents in order as per the checklist.

I maintained a balance of over \u20b91.5 lakh.\n* My Bangalore Rental Agreement (as proof of residence)\n* Photocopies of the front and back pages of my passport- this was discarded by visa officer\n\nFrom my Employer:\n* No Objection Certificate (NOC) stating the dates of my leave\n* Company ID card copy - discarded by visa officer\n* Last 3 months' salary slips\n\n**The VFS Appointment Day (JP Nagar):**\n\nI arrived at the VFS centre in JP Nagar about 30 minutes early. The ground floor was crowded with applicants for Schengen and UK visas. The first floor is designated for Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and a few other countries.\n\nI was initially told to come back 15 minutes before my scheduled time. Once I went in, the process was quite smooth:\n\n1.  Security & Token: After a quick security check, I was given a token.\n2.  Document Submission: When my token number was called, I went to the counter. The officer reviewed all my documents.\n3.  Payment: I was directed to the fee counter. Costed in total 1800 (including courier). \nTotal User Pay service: 550\nTotal Visa Fees: 450\nTotal VFS Service Fees: 800\n4.  Final Steps: I returned to the initial counter with the payment receipt. The officer took my application into a back room for a while. After he returned, I was asked to fill out the courier slip with my address and contact details.\n\nThe entire process inside the VFS center took about 50 minutes. The staff told me to expect a decision and the delivery of my passport within 5-7 working days.\n\n**Tracking:**\n\nI received a receipt with a tracking number. Unfortunately, as of now, I haven't been able to track the application online.\n\nIt's currently June 15th, so the waiting game begins! I'll be sure to post an update here once I receive my passport. Hope this helps anyone else going through the process!\n\n\nPlease Note: Don't bring any electronic items (except mobile obviously ) with you to VFS office. Just the documents.\n\n\nUPDATE: got single visit visa on 20th June",

We have already prepared a notarized and apostilled affidavit of support for this. We'll also show a secondary document showing where the funds came from (which is from rental income). My only concern is that the embassy might question the lack of movement of this savings account. What do you guys think?\n\n2.)

Knowing that the history is not all rosy between the two, it is giving me a slight worry that I will be limited for a while... \n\n4.

Ive been with my now wife (28f from the Philippines) have been together for roughly 5 years in a serious and committed loving relationship, we got married 6 months ago in canada where she is currently residing on a student visa. We are trying to figure out how to bring her to California with me. I like a gool quit my job 6 months ago. And just got a new one last week. I start this week. We're both really terrible with beaurocracy and paperwork, I feel incredibly stupid and lost when trying to do her paperwork. Im afraid im going to make a mistake, and im concerned about my lapse in work being an issue. I don't have a savings, I don't have any family willing to help or sign anything to help take financial responsibility even just on paper. My roommate offered but idk if that works. Frankly I feel lost and scared. I don't want to lose her and I know she doesn't want to lose me. We're both very tired and frustrated. In the last 5 years we've only met twice due to financial constraints. And they both were in the last 6 months. She came to canada almost a year ago for the student visa. Id gladly move up there to her if there was any easier way to do that. I genuinely don't know what to do and im just hoping someone can help steer us in the right direction. This isn't just a green card marriage, this is my wife and my best friend. Ive spent everyday for the last 5 years loving her, crying with her, fighting, teasing, joking, etc. She's the woman I decided I was going to spend the rest of my life with.\n\nSummary of info:\nMe: male 31 lives in California USA recently re-employed.\nWife: male to female trans, from Philippines, currently in canada on student visa.\nMoney situation: little to no savings, no family willing to help. Roommate/friend who is willing to help. I make 17 an hour as a budtender. 40 hours and overtime are easily achieved. Plus I donate plasma twice every week for extra income. \n\nIf I can provide any other info please let me know. Thank you for listening",

The coroner is currently investigating the cause, so it will be approx. 2 weeks before they release the body and death certificate. His family (mum and brother) lives in the EU and don\u2019t speak English. They asked me if I could deal with everything here as I live in England, too - collecting his stuff from the police/house, collecting death certificate, deal with cremation and transport to home country. They want to write a letter with a copy of their ID\u2019s to give me permission to collect the body, order cremation, transport his ashes, cancel his bank account etc. I read gov\u2019s website about what steps must be taken in case of someone\u2019s death. There is no will and the most valuable item is probably a laptop. We don\u2019t know how much money he\u2019s got in the bank, but I\u2019m almost 100% sure that all his belongings + money have value less than \u00a336,000 (small estate limit).\n\nMy question is - Is such a letter enough, so I can legally deal with all steps of this process? Do I need to involve a solicitor/court to get this permission officially?\n\nJust a note: the police called me several times to inform me about next steps etc and they said that because of this unique situation (his family being in different country and not speaking English), they can share details with me.\n\nNot sure if it\u2019s relevant, but I\u2019m EU citizen with settled status as well.\n\nThank you.",

I\u2019m wondering if the 1-year absence affects my eligibility for home fees, especially regarding the \u201cordinary residence\u201d requirement over the past 3 years.",

    "selftext": "**Testimony posted on our closed facebook group, the person agreed to share it anonymously**\n\n\nHi all,\n\n\nFirst of all, I'm so happy to find this forum! The Guardian was great in publishing these 2 articles.\nI don't know where to start. I hope I wont be too long. But I feel I need to speak up.\nI don't need any immigration law information, and I am well aware that this forum is not designed for this. I just hope to find the right emotional support as we stand better together.\n\n\nI am a French national. I came here in September 2007 straight after finishing my studies in France. I was just a 21 year old au pair. But like some of us, I decided to stay as I just fell in love with the country and the multiculturalism. I thought that we would have a better chance here in the UK as my partner was African. At the time, he was living in the Ivory Coast (a French speaking African country).\n\nIm not going to explain everything in details but we basically sorted everything paperwork wise by getting married in his country. I dealt with the Ivorian, the French, the EU and the UK laws. Each with their own drawbacks. The Ivorian in which every little bribes made things easier, the French one with its high bureaucracy and plain racism in the French consulate in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and I even had a personal menace at some point through private messages, from a staff in the French consulate in London! The British High Commission was really efficient in Ghana from where my husband travelled to the UK. And the EU law puts everything together by allowing us the right to live together as a family. It made the UK visa application possible by having it free. So my husband came here under a family permit, which lasted a few months. He then got granted a 5 year \u201cfamily member of an EEA national residency card\u201d (a specific type of visas for family members of EEA nationals), which once again was free of charge.\n\n5 years after, we then had to start the next process: asking a permanent residency card. The same one we are talking about.\nThis application is actually mainly designed for non EEA nationals who are a family member of EEA nationals. So any spouse of an EEA national: it could be a Vietnamese with a French, a Moroccan with a Spanish, etc, etc. for us, it\u2019s an Ivorian with a French. Whatever\u2026 At this time, we were separated but still married, and had 2 children.\n\nSo we applied for this permanent residency card in January 2016. It was a reasonable amount of \u00a365 (thanks to the EU laws). We spent days and days dealing with the application, around Christmas last year. At the end, we didn\u2019t have a big envelope to send, but a huge parcel of documents.\n\nThey said it would take them about 6 months to reply. They did it within 6 months. Actually, they wrote the letter the day of the result of the referendum. Now that is my opinion. Many people told me it was just pure coincidence. But for me it wasn\u2019t. I have been stabbed in the chest by the government. It is how I felt. \n\nSo here is their answer: my ex-partner father of our 2 daughters, had been asked to leave the country because\u2026 the Home Office denied my permanent right of residency. I have been here nearly 10 years. Newspapers that said that you are automatically granted permanent residency after 5 years is not true. As many of you have seen in this form, to have the right of residency, you need to prove that you were either a worker, self-employed, self-sufficient or full time student for 5 consecutive years. I proved everything during a 5 year period: 1 job, 1 maternity leave paid by my company, then another job and maternity leave paid by the government, as I didn\u2019t have enough hours at my second job to be able to get Statutory Maternity Pay. So my first maternity leave was accepted as I was still a worker, as the company paid me. But after that they though that I didn\u2019t earn enough as my P60 showed that I didn\u2019t earn enough. They didn\u2019t bother (point made by our lawyer) looking at all the documents: they simply said I didn\u2019t earn enough, therefore my job was not seen as \"genuine and effective\", but \"marginal and supplementary\". So the appeal is all about that: is a job marginal and supplementary when at the time I started, I was the only bread winner (my husband lost his job then) ? and then I went on maternity leave, however paid by the government. I was still an employee at the company. The EU laws also stated that there was no minimum hours required to be considered a worker. However, you just needed to show that your job is \"genuine and effective\".\nI am sorry to be a bit long, but here is the point I want to explain to people: the Home Office can turn the EU immigration laws as they wish. There is the Law and then, there is the interpretation of it all. They can just turn it around as they want. My story is real. I haven\u2019t lied anything. The father of my children is facing deportation (they also kept his passport) because his rights as a family member depends on my rights as an EEA national. By denying my permanent right to reside, they consequently say that my ex partner has no more right to stay in the UK.\n\nThis letter was written on the 24 of June 2016. We received it at the end of June. Although they mentioned the fact that we could appeal, there was no sign of a deadline in the letter. I had to dig the info online. When we managed to get an interview with an immigration lawyer, just a few days later, we calculated that the deadline was the day after the appointment! It is how they are. They send their decision letter second post and don\u2019t give you any clues about your appeal\u2019s rights. However, the grounds of appeal have been sent a few months ago now. So far, we haven\u2019t had any news from the immigration tribunal yet. At first, I hoped they would take some time, as it allows us to save the \u00a33000 needed for having a lawyer with us. Now I wish the tribunal could speed up a bit. I don\u2019t want this to take years, to find out that these EU regulations we are fighting for will be scrapped by the Brexit decisions.\nAs I said, I felt I have been stabbed by the government and I am talking with some immigration paperwork background behind me. At first I was in denial, and just angry, and could just manage to grab a few documents here and there needed for the appeal. That was in July. But now, I can see the file I have made, just under a pile of bills, and I can\u2019t touch it anymore. Looking at it, makes me cry or want to scream. I am in a total blockage over this. Our lawyer asks us so many other things, but although we have most of it, I just can\u2019t sit down and work on it. I am still in shock, months later. I have been hurt so badly by this decision I can\u2019t really explain completely. I know I would have to sit down and do it at some point, but at the moment, I just can\u2019t. And I am a person applying to study at uni for a midwifery degree. Nobody could deny my rights to have a family, my rights to have a pregnancy and a paid maternity leave. I can\u2019t understand their decision. It is just beyond my understanding, especially the impact it has on my family.\nI am sorry it is not a short text. But I really need people to understand my situation. I don\u2019t need any immigration law information. I am just here to say my story, and explain that nobody is safe. Nobody can plainly assume that they could have their permanent right of residency, especially because on the other hand, the HMRC granted my 5 year right of residency. So in fact, they disagree between themselves. But the Home Office is above the HMRC, no matter what.\n\nI contacted the Royal College of Midwives, because their CEO, Cathy Warwick, has always been clear on the importance of EU nationals working in the NHS and defend the right of all EU nationals settled in the UK to stay here. So I wrote a personal letter to her, to thank her and explain my situation. She thanked me personally with a long personal letter too. She also said that it is because/thanks to people like me that she will always speak up for EU nationals rights to work and live here. I was grateful for it. Now I will certainly thank The Guardian, something I wanted to do for a while. It is the only paper who mentioned that living in the UK for 5 years is not enough for permanent right residency.\n\nIm in limbo. I can\u2019t really open another case and ask my own permanent residency certificate (it is a certificate for EEA members, but a card-visa styled document attached to the passport for a non EEA national). Even though, the case is on my partner\u2019s name, the arguments are about me\u2026\n\n\nI wish people all the luck and courage and apply for their permanent right of residency certificate. I\u2019m just drained at the moment.\nI don\u2019t want to cause fear to people. Just to share my personal experience about it all.\nThank you very much for reading me. I am more than grateful for your support.\nLets help each other in this situation.\n\n\nC.",

Without physical or saved digital documentation, migrants will be exposed to data errors, system crashes and Internet outages. People could be unable to prove their right to be in the UK.\n\nMigrants' proof of status will be checked in real-time. Using algorithmic guesswork, application records will be live matched and rematched across multiple databases. It carries the risk of potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of errors. Errors that can have life-changing consequences.\n\nThis fragile system of real-time checking was used for the EU Settlement Scheme. Reports collected by the3million show cases of mismatched records, out-of-date decisions and technical glitches preventing access.\n\nIn March, the government admitted that their new casework database, Atlas, had mismatched people's identities in 70,000 records. With 4 million people needing e-Visas, even a small error rate creates a vast number of people wrongly denied access to work, services or unable to enter the UK.\n\nThe switch to e-Visas at the end of 2024 creates a system where a person's right to be in the UK can glitch out, or get turned off by the Home Office in real-time as soon as it thinks there might be a reason to do so.

    "selftext": "Every day I see more and more reasons to not like Farage. I don\u2019t get why he/Reform are popular among some circles besides for the bombastic rhetoric, but that doesn\u2019t count for anything once you start analysing things.\n\nFirstly, Reform apparently wants to leave the ECHR because of \u201ccriminals\u201d. But after the last Tory government, it\u2019s only shown me how important it is to have guardrails against a government that thinks it is invincible. I\u2019d rather keep my human rights via the ECHR than surrender them to Farage, a man who only cares about advancing his political career.\n\nSecondly, I\u2019ve learned that Reform is pretty against remote working. This is the LAST thing a politician should be mad about. The majority of hybrid/remote workers show happiness with their arrangements. Flexible working cuts commuting costs, saves time sitting like a zombie in rush hour traffic, and gives people location flexibility. So, if Farage wants to be a man of the working people, why does he push against measures that the working people say are positive for them?! Hm...\n\nThirdly, Farage and Reform are obsessed with climate change denial. Reform-led Durham county council voted to scrap the climate emergency warning dating from 2019, which is clownery when we\u2019ve just experienced a drought and heatwave. Climate change is real, and it's here.\n\nFarage also paints all migrants on benefits as \u201ccharity users\u201d, and published a piece in the Daily Mail calling for an end to benefits for foreign nationals. This is illegal and unworkable in the real world, particularly for EU settled status holders (EU nationals who\u2019ve lived here since before 2021), who have recognised rights to access public services + funds.\n\nLastly, Reform has also proposed to cut benefits for all job-seekers beyond 4 months. This is so ludicrously unrealistic it's not even funny. It will send countless people into quick financial distress whilst not giving them a long-term tailored pathway into the workforce. What will happen to all the jobs programmes to help the disadvantaged? If Reform wants to cut unemployment, they need to implement structural change that will deliver more jobs. Otherwise, they're just punishing the poor, and I don't respect that.\n\nAnd also, the whole trickery behind saying our country is declining because we just \u201cdidn't do Brexit hard enough\u201d and \u201cwe need Reform to make Brexit work\u201d. It's so disingenuous and I don't respect that either. It's not like we have one of the worst inequality statistics in the rich world or anything.",

Maybe they would approve my ESTA but then at the borders, my fingerprints would flag and they\u2019d open my sealed record and be like \u201cyou lied\u201d.\n\nIs my only/the best option the Hranka waiver?\n\nAppreciate the advice is probably to speak to a lawyer, which I plan to do but would like some initial guidance on my questions if possible first.",

We are trying to figure out how to get him over here to the US with an F1 student visa. He wants to study at a community college to get an associates degree for the program he was studying in his country. My family and I are willing to be his financial sponsor, but obviously the intention in the end is to have him end up as a US resident (after applying to continue education for a bachelors and completing that, or getting married during his studies). Obviously, this won't look good from the perspective of a Visa interviewer. The intentions are 100% true for why he wants to study in the US, it is incomparable to his options where he lives. He wants to pursue his degree. How do we frame this situation to work out in his favor? Should we transfer the funds to someone else and make up a story or be honest about the relationship? Help please!!",

As a family we had previously overstayed in US(dad had his reasons) but we were deported. My mom was a housewife and generally just followed as the events played out. I\u2019m currently in US and want her to attend my masters graduation ceremony. However she was not given a VISA previously two times for my undergraduate ceremony on the basis of overstaying. It was over 15 years ago that we had overstayed. I had no problems acquiring a student visa as I was under 18 but unfortunately it looks like even though the \u201cban\u201d is up she still can\u2019t get a tourist visa. Is there anything we can do other than keep trying to get her a tourist visa? Is there a ban waiver process that we need to look into? We did not get deported on the basis of any crime or anything, just normally overstayed. Looking forward to hearing from you guys",

    "selftext": "As the title says, if someone applies to the US for a tourist visa and for some reason it is denied; and then this person subsequently applies for a student visa as part their post graduate education will the denied tourist visa have any substantial negative affect on getting the student visa approved?\n\nBasically, I have a friend who is interested in immigrating to the US through school but would like to come visit first before making the commitment to apply to schools in the US. It seems logical to me that this should be allowed but she\u2019s coming from Iran which has all sorts of immigration obstacles and as such could get denied. \n\nWould this attempt at a tourist visa hurt her chances to apply later? She has European and Canadian tourist visas already. ",

    "title": "Marrying non-US citizen - legal issues, concerns, pitfalls? (x-post from r/immigration)",
    "selftext": "I have been dating a girl from another country for almost exactly two years now and we have been living together for roughly the same amount of time. She is currently here on a student visa. Her visa will run out in about six more months. She has been applying for jobs for a year and finally landed a short term job in her field, however they have told her that, while they would like to hire her permanently, even if they were willing to go through the sponsorship process for her, it would take more than a year to get her sponsored, based on their experience with another of their employees.\n\nWhile I genuinely love my girlfriend in the deepest sense of the word, I do not truly feel like I am at the point of being ready to marry her as I\u2019ve always felt that I would need to be with someone for several years before feeling comfortable enough to marry them. However I do not want her to be forced to leave when her visa expires, so I have been strongly considering marrying her so we can remain together in the United States.\n\nI\u2019ve already done the research regarding prenuptial agreements and the mechanics of her applying for citizenship in the US once we have married. My question is, are there any legal pitfalls I am unknowingly opening myself up to? For instance, I read something recently that a US citizen who marries a non-citizen who later gains US citizenship is required to take care of the new citizen for five years from the date of marriage, regardless of whether or not they divorce in that time period. I haven\u2019t been able to find any additional info to confirm or deny this. I obvious do not expect that we would be getting divorced, but I also know that we are both humans and humans change, etc. I have seen plenty of seemingly excellent relationships crumble during my short time on this earth, so I am aware that just because something is a certain way presently does not mean that it will be that way in perpetuity.\n\nSo, again, I am looking for advice on any problems/issues/concerns to look out for or be aware of. Imagine I am your son and I have just called you to get your motherly/fatherly advice based on the information above.\n\nEDIT: Also, any suggestions regarding alternate (legal) ways to accomplish the goal of my girlfriend continuing to stay in the US are certainly welcome!",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been searching everywhere but I can't find a satisfying answer that would tell me whether or not I should make this trip.\n\nI just started a PhD degree in the US. I'm a Canadian citizen with an F-1 student visa, and my partner is from Iran. I have the visa for entry to Iran ready to go meet their family there, but I can't tell whether it's too risky to go right now. I know that no non-US citizens can expect uninterrupted travel across US borders right now, but things with Iran specifically are making me worried that I might be prevented from coming back to continue my degree, even after I apply for the post-Iran trip visa that's required for anyone.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight on this? What are my rights here, as a non-citizen? Would I merely miss a flight back in, or would they stop me entirely? If they can indeed stop me from coming back into the US on my visa for all time, what percent chance is there that that would actually happen?\n\nI know that everything's up in the air with such a xenophobic administration, but it's really important that I both make this trip and continue my studies. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n",

I am 20 years old, going to school for nursing. \nDo I have any options for financial aid to go to school in America?\nWhat are the chances of me finding a job that would be willing to sponsor me for a work visa since I do not have a profession?\nDo I have any other options of ways to live in America?\nThis is so overwhelming for me and any help or advice would be so so so greatly appreciated!\nThank you for your time!",
